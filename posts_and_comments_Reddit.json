We are a product of the natural world no different from an ant or a beaver, but beyond that life isn’t a question of morality it just is. We are the most successful species right now and other species have had to pay the price just as many others have in the past when they met a superior competitor. Obviously, as sapient creatures capable of understanding the consequences of our actions we should, and I believe will, work to mitigate them. And I’d like to point out again that we, as far as we know right now, are the only spacefaring things in the universe, the only things that can spread life off of earth and ensure its survival beyond the lifetime of the sun, and because of that we must protect our environment and biodiversity but also continue to develop technologically so that we can do what I feel is our moral obligation.

Combining newly gathered information about lobbyists’ resources and policy outcomes with the largest survey of lobbyists  ever  conducted,  I  find  surprisingly  little  relationship  between  organizations’  financial  resources  and  their  policy success—but greater money is linked to certain lobbying tactics and traits, and some of these are linked to greater policy success.\n\n-[Dr. Amy McKay](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1016.1967&rep=rep1&type=pdf), 2011",

This is often overlooked, and most people just leave the water running while they brush. Truth is you only need it to rinse off the toothpaste. If you only use water to rinse off, you could save up to 24,000 gallons of water per year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecycle your dental products\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7egwc3whx1u21.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a5c932c74d7324c5b25935d68a32f2eeb881a32\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can also help by using eco-friendly dental products; you only need to check the label to find out if what you are using of made of recycled materials. It only takes a small effort. Also remember to recycle you old dental products, there are many programs that take care of it for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStart a healthy diet\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pmm9siwhx1u21.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=204c23ab01c3f9858ec4be83effdf7f3a2b6aabe\n\nMaybe the most important tip is to have a healthier diet, like reducing the times you order take out or keeping a water bottle instead of picking up a soda, this way you are not only making sure your teeth are healthier, you also reduce the amount of trash, such as plastic containers, that you produce per day.\n\nTaking care of the environment is similar to keeping your body healthy, you prepare yourself for the future. Try using these tips for a year, and see how much this helps you reduce your waste.\n\n\\#earthday #earthdayeveryday #nature #motherearth #enviroment #ecofriendly #recycling #green #climatechange #dentalhealth #health #oralhealth #smile #healthyteeth #dentaltourism #medicaltourism\n\n(full article) \n\nhttp://www.dentaltourismexico.com/Dental\\_Tourism\\_news\n\n[https://medium.com/@dentaltourismx/how-your-dental-health-help-the-environment-6bd0a0557f2d](https://medium.com/@dentaltourismx/how-your-dental-health-help-the-environment-6bd0a0557f2d) \n\n[http://dentaltourismtravel.blogspot.com/2019/04/how-your-dental-health-help-environment.html](http://dentaltourismtravel.blogspot.com/2019/04/how-your-dental-health-help-environment.html)",

        "title": "Can we have an earnest conversation about what we need to do to solve the very real environmental problems facing the world today?",
        "text": "I've seen a lot of negativity on Reddit when it comes to enviromental issues, and while the cause for concern is real, the hopelessness is not only not entirely based in reality, but counterproductive. According to experts, the [extinction risk from climate change is between 9-19% over the next hundred years](http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.html). That's unacceptably high, but it's far from too high to give up. If we want to stay below 2 ºC warming, for example, we need a carbon price of [$20/tonne by 2020, $100/tonne by 2030, and $140/tonne by 2040, and enough political will to overcome the natural gas industry](https://www.nature.com/news/natural-gas-stands-to-get-a-boost-from-carbon-tax-1.17705). If we really care about environmental problems, there are plenty of effective actions we can (and should) take:\n\n* [**We need to vote**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U). It may sounds trite (or cynical) but whether or not you vote is a matter of public record, and if [EVP can write an algorithm with 89% accuracy to figure out if you care about the environment/climate change](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sites/default/files/2017-impact-report.pdf), then so can politicians, and politicians only care about their voting bloc, so if you don't vote, you and your values can safely be ignored by those in power. [Stinnett argues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U) (rather persuasively, imho) that the reason climate change didn't end up in the last debates is because of the anemic turnout among environmentalists. If we want politicians to care about the environment, we need to show them that it's worth their while.  I've personally donated over $100 to [EVP](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/) because it turns out [it's really cheap to turn out environmental voters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U)), and EVP currently only has enough funds to operate in 6 U.S. states. We tend to [grossly underestimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance#Examples) how much the rest of the public agrees with us on this stuff, but the truth is, [the number of people who say climate change is extremely important to them, personally, is at an all-time high](https://earth.stanford.edu/news/public-support-climate-policy-remains-strong).  So let's not squander this opportunity. With [~15 million superenvironmentalists across the U.S. not voting](https://thinkprogress.org/15-million-super-environmentalists-dont-vote-in-the-midterms/), we could truly be a force to be reckoned with and make demands of those in power if only we showed up. If you have money to [donate](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/donate), please do. If you don't, you could probably be at least as effective by [volunteering](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/get-involved). If you don't have time to volunteer, please at least [sign the pledge](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sign-the-pledge) to get reminders about upcoming elections in your local area, and maybe share your committment on social media or invite some friends to join you.\n\n* Maybe you have a hard time mustering the will to vote because none of the candidates fit your ideals perfectly (if you really despise them all equally, at least vote for a write-in so you still show up as a voter). Either way, there's a really good chance that whoever wins will not be perfect. So **what we need to do is lobby**. [Lobbying works](https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/friends_or_foes-how_social_movement_allies_affect_the_passage_of_legislation_in_the_u._s._congress.pdf), and [you don't need a lot of money to do it](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41759323?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) -- though it *does* help to [know effective tactics](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf) (hint: [write, call, and visit *your* member of Congress](https://twitter.com/editoremilye/status/797243415922515970?lang=en)). Even those members of Congress who seem hopeless [can make a change for the better with the right approach](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/lobbying/creating-champions-in-congress-and-in-the-media/). [Climate change is arguably one of the most pressing issues](https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/) facing humanity today. If we want to stay below 1.5 ºC warming (a [wise choice, and still possible](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-report-exclusive/exclusive-warming-set-to-exceed-1-5c-slow-economic-growth-u-n-draft-idUSKBN1JA1HD)) we will need to get off fossil fuels, which means [we will need a carbon tax](http://news.mit.edu/2016/carbon-tax-stop-using-fossil-fuels-0224), which is expected to [spur innovation](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2f60/cbfc3dcf2538140bbf07f43cf7038b8af8c8.pdf) while also [reducing emissions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy). If you're interested in free training in how to lobby Congress/Parliament, [Citizens' Climate Lobby](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/) offers free training to anyone in the world (though if you live in Kuwait, you may have to start your own chapter) in how to lobby for [Carbon Fee & Dividend](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/basics-carbon-fee-dividend/), a policy supported by [scientists](http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199856978.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199856978-e-026) and [economists](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.381.484&rep=rep1&type=pdf). Pricing carbon would also have significant [co-benefits of reduced local air pollution that are sizeable enough to make the policy in each nation's own best interest](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15105.pdf) (e.g. [thousands of lives would be saved in the U.S. alone](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy)). The policy would also likely reduce plastic waste, since plastics are made with fossil fuels, and fossil fuels would be more expensive under the policy. It [may come as a surprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance#Examples), but a majority of Americans in [each political party](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf) and [every Congressional district](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2018/) supports a carbon tax. CCL is maybe ~45k volunteers from passing CF&D in the U.S., but that's peanuts when you consider that [10% of Americans (that's tens of *millions*) would 'definitely' be willing to join a campaign to convince elected officials to mitigate climate](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf). [30% of Americans](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-May-2017.pdf) would be willing to join such a campaign if someone they like and respected asked them to, so bring a friend or two. I've personally donated thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours to CCL (and recruited more than a couple friends) because I think what they're doing is so important. If you can devote about an hour a week to lobby for a liveable planet, [sign up here](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/) for the free training. If you don't have time to train as a lobbyist, please at least sign up for free [text alerts](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/text/) so you can join coordinated call-in days. \n\n* I know there's a climate march coming up [this Saturday](https://peoplesclimate.org/), but while [protests can be effective at raising awareness](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/stop_raising_awareness_already), we are well [beyond](http://www.climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Six-Americas-2018-Mar.png) the point of awareness being a barrier to climate change, and [protests are not effective at passing legislation](https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/friends_or_foes-how_social_movement_allies_affect_the_passage_of_legislation_in_the_u._s._congress.pdf), for [reasons that will be obvious](https://www.ttbook.org/interview/barney-frank-why-protests-dont-work). **We** [**need to graduate to effective tactics**](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/21/is-there-any-point-to-protesting) if we want to actually accomplish things that matter, and [protests can be an effective jumping-off point](https://qz.com/901411/political-protests-are-effective-but-not-for-the-reason-you-think/) for doing that. So, if you're planning to marth this Saturday, maybe you can get some people there to, for example, [sign the Environmental Voter Pledge](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sign-the-pledge). \n\n\n* **Population growth** is something [both the public and scientists are worried about](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/08/scientists-more-worried-than-public-about-worlds-growing-population/). There are [plenty of effective actions to take](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/361/6403/650.full.pdf?casa_token=eWZHHLNe6SwAAAAA:Vwhrywg2A8q_GOA1g1IjwZOaegqcHXkPIhWjDoVQfbgIwKiMHEOS7OXsn5bxSeMy5ANNN8U2kOswp5o) to curb population growth that *don't* involve [human rights violations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights#Sexual_and_reproductive_rights)), so please don't advocate for oppressive limits on the number of children other people can have. Rather, if you want to help curb overpopulation, [it would help to improve childhood mortality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=QsBT5EQt348), by, say [donating to](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities) the Against Malaria Foundation, or [donating to girls' education](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/education) to reduce fertility. Roughly [32 million unplanned births occur each year](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4727534/). Even in developed countries, [unintended pregnancies are common and costly](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/cdc-40-percent-us-births-unintended/story?id=16840288), and can have [deleterious effects on offspring](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3775543/), including a [higher risk of maltreatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26070372). [Implants, IUD, and sterilization](https://www.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Gynecologic-Practice/Increasing-Access-to-Contraceptive-Implants-and-Intrauterine-Devices-to-Reduce-Unintended-Pregnancy) are the most effective forms of birth control (yet [sterilization is often denied to women who know they don't want children](https://www.ted.com/talks/christen_reighter_i_don_t_want_children_stop_telling_me_i_ll_change_my_mind)) and [policies which give young people free access to the most reliable forms of birth control can greatly reduce unintended pregnancies](https://www.denverpost.com/2017/11/30/colorado-teen-pregnancy-abortion-rates-drop-free-low-cost-iud/).

As long as you assume our political institutions are not completely ethically bankrupt and hopeless, it should be one of your main concerns.\n\nVoting and the institutions relying on it mean very little if the voting process is fundamentally flawed and fails to represent the intent of the voters, and the information they are giving to the democratic processes. This is true both for the election of representatives to the way these representatives vote among themselves.\n\nSo why on Earth are we insisting on precisely the wrong methods for 2500 years? \n\nThe world desperately needs voting systems that promote maximization of consent and work towards consensus, not polarizing sides which only retaliate and waste time, resources and are easily swayed by corporate interests. This would allow new, truly representative positions and ideologies to hold official power and enact the decisions to remove corporate power from society and politics.\n\nOnly cardinal (non-ranked non-preferential) voting systems can do this while being simple enough to be adopted, because cardinal voting is not a zero-sum game. All voting being done today in the world is a zero-sum game, which is divisive and leads to a whole range of political, social and cultural problems.\n\nAs long as you admit money in politics work and attempt to use it, you already lost the battle. We need to dispel this idea that people have power over society because they are consumers and can boycott corporations. No. People have power because they are human beings, citizens, workers, voters. People have power because they are members of a society, not mere agents in an economy. \n\nSo they have power, right now, because they vote. So let's make the damn thing count for once in the history of our civilization.\n\nOther than that, I think we should stop framing the environmental problem solely in terms of climate change. Climate change is one of many interrelated environmental issues we're facing today in critical stages, but it's getting all of the attention. \n\n",

Who out there is going to alter their behavior for .13 per gallon? No one. \n\n> because emphasizing individual solutions to global problems reduces support for government action, and only governments have the power to impose taxes\n\nThis knife cuts both ways. If you institute an ineffective carbon tax, people assume they don't need to make individual cuts to their footprint as they are contributing their 'fair' share via carbon tax. \n\nUnfortunately, to effect consumer behavior, carbon taxing would need to be onerous. If the carbon tax is onerous, it's going to hit the poor incredibly hard and be unpopular.  Can you imagine our increasingly polarized political parties coming together and instituting a carbon tax? That's why I advocate for things we can do now to reduce our carbon footprint. \n\nFurther, I think one of the biggest faults is that we don't have a very good carbon footprint spokesperson. Businesses may give a green press release, but they are not advertising it the way they should. Likewise, TV shows all these carbon hogs but doesn't really do anything similar for small footprints. \n\nIf you look back in time for similar magnitude projects, think WW2 victory gardens and posters like \"Use it up, wear it out, make it do! Or do without! Our labor and our goods are fighting!\"\n\nThis 80% reduction in CO2 is of similar scope and yet our leaders are largely absent when it comes to getting it done. ",

        "text": "You see the galaxies, planets, and stars throughout the vast universe as *Put On Your Sunday Clothes* quietly hums in the background. You’re taken to a brown planet, whose very atmosphere is filled with debris, the cheery tune providing a sharp contrast to your sight. The entire landscape of Planet Earth is covered in skyscrapers, most of which are formed from blocks of garbage. Finally, you see the source of *Put On Your Sunday Clothes*, a lonesome robot, stacking these garbage monuments on a lifeless Earth. The fictional dystopia from Disney’s [*Wall-E*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLx_7wEmwms) is slowly becoming a reality. We are churning the world in which we live into a lifeless trash heap. \n\nWhether it’s speeding up the process of melting the polar ice caps through our immense methane emission, or being forced to use plastic in nearly everything throughout our daily lives, this Earth is turning into a barren wasteland. Life is being taken away in order to create a desolate planet. You may be wondering how you are in any way responsible for this catastrophe, and you’re not wrong for doing so. The daily actions of any human being, through using things like plastic water bottles, or even driving to work, cause more pollution than any other animal; these actions are taken for granted, and there are few alternatives out there. Try to name a company that makes water bottles out of something other than plastic; the only one that is somewhat widely known is Voss, which uses glass *and* plastic for their different water bottles. The fact of the matter is that plastic water bottles, which will virtually never decompose, are one of the largest factors in the creation of something known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, which is a collection of debris in the Pacific Ocean. Before you conjure up an image of one massive island of garbage, be aware that the GPGP consists of several patches throughout the Pacific. Here's an eye-opening fact from Annie Leonard’s *The Story of Bottled Water*; be aware that this only makes up a fraction (a pretty sizable one, but a fraction nonetheless) of these massive patches.\n>People in the U.S. buy more than half a billion bottles of water *every week*. That’s enough to circle the globe more than 5 times. [(Leonard *The Story of Bottled Water* Page 2)](http://storyofstuff.org/wp-content/uploads/movies/scripts/SoBottledWater_Annotated_Script.pdf)\n\nThat immense amount of bottled water, most of which isn’t recycled much like all the other various plastic materials used in daily life, eventually leads into the Pacific Ocean where all the currents meet. At this point, there is a gathering of all the garbage that is disposed into the ocean. It collects together and continues to grow larger and larger every day. National Geographic’s article on the GPGP offers insight as to not only the size of the patch, but the dangers of it as well. \n\n>In the ocean, the sun breaks down these plastics into tinier and tinier pieces, a process known as photodegradation. Scientists have collected up to 750,000 bits of microplastic in a single square kilometer of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch—that’s about 1.9 million bits per square mile. Most of this debris comes from plastic bags, bottle caps, plastic water bottles, and Styrofoam cups… The seafloor beneath the Great Pacific Garbage Patch may also be an underwater trash heap. Oceanographers and ecologists recently discovered that about 70% of marine debris actually sinks to the bottom of the ocean. [(National Geographic’s *Great Pacific Garbage Patch*)](http://education.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/great-pacific-garbage-patch/)\n\nThis patch has become so large that it is measured in miles (The GPGP is estimated to approximately be one and a half times the size of Texas state). So the GPGP has already reached an immense size, but the surface-level and measurable amounts of waste are only a small part of the entire patch. It’s like an iceberg, seemingly enormous from the surface, but unfathomably larger underneath.\n\nSpeaking of ice, the immense amount of methane released from factories and automobiles is causing the polar ice caps to melt faster and faster. Our species creates its own island, while destroying a natural one. Whether we are a catalyst, or the prime and only factor, the polar caps continually decrease in size every year. This climate change has had dreadful effects on the various wildlife of the ice worlds. For example, the polar bear must often swim for miles in search of food, when at one point they could simply prey for seals on the shores of their ice lands. Currently, polar bears are becoming more and more desperate for survival, and often target more dangerous prey for food, such as the walrus. As a polar bear, traveling for days on end in search of food, exhausted from the journey, attempts to attack a heard of walruses, it becomes apart of a growing statistic; a statistic that projects the eventual extinction of this species if they cannot more easily find food. These bears, which rely on ice as their main source of travel during the spring and summer, and for their warm hibernation den during the winter, are unable to adapt to these rapid changes in their ecosystem. If there is no change made, it might spell the end of the polar bear. Humans are the catalyst for the melting of the polar caps that keep these bears alive. \n> Globally, over 60% of total CH4 emissions come from human activities [(U.S. EPA)](http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/ch4.html). \n\n\nThis U.S. Environmental Protection Agency article is quoted as saying that we produce well over half of the world's CH4 emission. This, which is mostly out of the regular person's control, could be reduced easily. The amount of factories that produce alone that, if reduced, could slow down this melting process immensely. Currently, there is an entire continent dwindling away from the heat created through the release of these gasses, and an army of garbage patches taking their place.\n\nSo, I guess we’re screwed, right? Well, not exactly. For example, as said earlier in this post, Voss is one of the only water bottle producers that offers a glass bottle. Aside from possibility of dropping the bottle and cutting your big toe, there is nothing to lose in switching to glass. If people make fun of you for driving a small car, just know that you’re making sure our future generations don't end up like the passive consumers in *Wall-E*. While these two things may be a world-wide problem, the action towards change begins with you. If you’re an avid fan of bottled water, try switching to tap because it’s much cheaper, or, if you need that bottle, look into some other non-planet-destroying options. If you’re looking for a new car, don’t rule out the possibility of something fuel-efficient. It’s not just about saving the polar bears, it’s about preserving all life on this earth, to allow our planet to continue it’s natural cycle. With a small adjustment to our daily lives, we can make sure that a lone tiny robot, compacting piles of garbage into cubes and stacking them to skyscraper height, remains in the movies. ",

He knew the hardy green shrub thrives in blistering heat and can survive months with little water.\n\nHis initial investment was much more than a water scarcity choice. Guayule (pronounced why-OO-lee) could be, within the next decade, a source of rubber for tire manufacturers in the United States.\n\nInvestment in the crop has skyrocketed. In 2022, the Agriculture Department and Bridgestone, the tire and rubber company, gave University of Arizona researchers $70 million in funding to help them grow and process guayule — the first time in the crop’s century of cultivation where government, academic and industry professionals have united around its development. Bridgestone has also funneled more than $100 million into guayule exploration since 2012 and now boasts its own 281-acre guayule farm in Eloy, Ariz. IndyCar even debuted guayule-made tires on the racetrack in 2022 and expanded the initiative to every street circuit race this season.\n\nThese moves come at an inflection point for the global rubber supply chain. Natural rubber cultivation, centralized in Southeast Asia, is increasingly subject to climate change and geopolitical instability. Synthetic rubber production has boomed in the last century and makes up 70 percent of the rubber used in the manufacturing process today — a $31.1 billion market as of 2022, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, which [tracks](https://oec.world/en/profile/hs/synthetic-rubber?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template) economic data. Natural rubber production has lagged behind, with an estimated market size of $2.38 billion in 2022. Rubber is widely considered one of the most crucial commodities on Earth, but the United States has never made a sustained effort to establish a domestic natural supply — until now.\n\nRead more here: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2024/guayule-us-rubber-new-sustainable-tires/?itid=hp\\_climate-health-wellness\\_p007\\_f002?utm\\_campaign=wp\\_main&utm\\_medium=social&utm\\_source=reddit.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2024/guayule-us-rubber-new-sustainable-tires/?itid=hp_climate-health-wellness_p007_f002?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit.com)",

                "body": "From the article: Polar bears in some parts of the high Arctic are developing ice buildup and related injuries to their feet, apparently due to changing sea ice conditions in a warming Arctic. While surveying the health of two polar bear populations, researchers found lacerations, hair loss, ice buildup and skin ulcerations primarily affecting the feet of adult bears as well as other parts of the body. Two bears had ice blocks up to 1 foot (30 centimeters) in diameter stuck to their foot pads, which caused deep, bleeding cuts and made it difficult for them to walk.\n\nThe [study](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.4435) led by the University of Washington was published Oct. 22 in the journal Ecology. It’s the first time that such injuries have been documented in polar bears.\n\nThe researchers suggest several mechanisms for how the shift from a climate that used to remain well below freezing to one with freeze–thaw cycles could be causing ice buildup and injuries.\n\n“In addition to the anticipated responses to climate change for polar bears, there are going to be other, unexpected responses,” said lead author Kristin Laidre, a senior principal scientist at the UW Applied Physics Laboratory and a professor in the UW School of Aquatic and Fishery sciences. “As strange as it sounds, with climate warming there are more frequent freeze-thaw cycles with more wet snow, and this leads to ice buildup on polar bears’ paws.”",

Companies such as Ecovative have pioneered growing mycelium for use in food, leather-like textiles and packaging materials, while MycoWorks transforms humble ingredients like sawdust, bran, water and mycelium into leather, cotton and silk. Scientific researchers are pioneering new ways for fungi to better manage environmental problems such as transforming food waste into [novel edible materials](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878450X23001683?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template), eliminating toxins like heavy metals at contamination sites, devouring plastic pollution, or improving soil as an [impressive organic fertilizer.](https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/sum.12811?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template)\n\nNot unlike the renewed fervor about the mind-expanding potential of psychedelics, some entrepreneurial success has come from thinking way outside the box, sometimes literally. Loop, a Dutch company, sells coffins made of mushroom and hemp fibers that decompose in weeks, the mushroom drawing sustenance from the human remains. And other human waste is getting a fresh look — Pact Outdoors offers bathroom kits for backpackers that include mycelium tablets that break down poop quickly, killing bacteria that can disturb ecosystems.\n\nRead more here: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2024/mushroom-mycelium-sustainability-leather-shoes/?itid=hp\\_world-climate\\_p006\\_f007?utm\\_campaign=wp\\_main&utm\\_medium=social&utm\\_source=reddit.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2024/mushroom-mycelium-sustainability-leather-shoes/?itid=hp_world-climate_p006_f007?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit.com)",

It's also an easier pitch to do it for the sake of the same planet that they too live on instead of some moral argument that they obviously disagree with.\n\nOne vegan and six meat-eaters are just as bad for the planet as seven people all of whom only do meatless mondays. In either case it's seven people who do seven meatless days combined every week. Therefore, putting aside other moral considerations and focusing only on the planet, if you can convince at least seven people to do meatless mondays or an equivalent practice with less effort than it would be to convert one vegan, then you should do so instead of preaching veganism.

Changing course (to avoid the collision) will require extreme downward shifts in meat and dairy consumption by large segments of the world’s population. Other approaches such as food waste reduction and precision agriculture and/or other technological advances have to be simultaneously pursued; however, they are insufficient to make the global food system sustainable.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/precision-agriculture)\"\n\n[We conclude that reduced ruminant meat and dairy consumption will be indispensable for reaching the 2 °C target with a high probability, unless unprecedented advances in technology take place.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-014-1104-5?sa_campaign=email/event/articleAuthor/onlineFirst)\n\n[If the world adopted a plant-based diet we would reduce global agricultural land use from 4 to 1 billion hectares.](https://ourworldindata.org/land-use-diets)\n\n[Our global food system is the primary driver of biodiversity loss, with agriculture alone being the identified threat to 24,000 of the 28,000 (86%) species at risk of extinction.

There’s no mention of fertilizer runoff or soil erosion or increasing extinction rates among insects.\n\nHope is great.

This disastrous trend has contributed to growing numbers of people facing water shortages and food insecurity, as rivers and lakes have dried up, pollution has increased and food sources, such as freshwater fisheries, have dwindled. \n\nIn the Danube basin 80% of the floodplains - essential for flood and drought risk mitigation, groundwater recharge, and water filtration - has been lost along the Danube and tributaries. Today, a mere 16% of the rivers in the Danube Basin retain their natural or near-natural state and less than further 20% are near-natural to slightly altered. \n\nUnsustainable agricultural practices are among the primary threats to rivers and floodplains. According to the World Bank, agriculture currently accounts for over 70% of the freshwater used by humanity. Over-extraction for crop irrigation reduces the water available for other uses, such as natural flows that support fisheries, and contributes to water shortages. Intensive agriculture lands occupied the territories of former floodplains, which resulted in reducing the purification, flood and drought risk capacities of the river systems. Meanwhile, excessive fertiliser use creates diffuse pollution affecting surface and groundwaters.",

But that’s all it is. A big number. Yes, it’s a lot. But sixty-three billion gallons of water tells us nothing about how sufficient that performance is.\n\n>I went digging to see how Apple arrived at this number. In ‘People and Environment in their Supply Chain 2023 Annual Progress Report’, their global supply chain leader Sabih Khan proudly refers to it in his cover letter (p3) and there is more detail in the water stewardship section (p85). \n\n>What we learn is 63 billion gallons is a cumulative saving over ten years. It’s across ten regions and countries. To assess the sustainability of water use in the annual sustainability report, we would need to know how much water was used this year in location x (the numerator), and that would be assessed against a denominator, which would be the company’s fair share of water in that location. Some areas are more water-stressed than others so what’s fair would vary site by site.\n\nFor reference, a lone gas fired turbine power plant can use more than 63 billion gallons a year. 63 billion gallons over ten years across multiple countries is absolutely nothing.",

But it is excreted and dumped into the water where it can harm shrimps, crabs, lobsters and other crustaceans.”\n\n“WildFish pointed out that emamectin was “highly toxic” and had been found to have a “persistent and detrimental” impact on marine wildlife. “Weakening the proposed safety limits for this chemical could have profound and long-term ecological impacts,” warned the group’s campaign manager, Dr Matt Palmer.”\n\n“According to a UKTAG memo from 24 February released by Sepa, Salmon Scotland’s latest intervention relied on an “original, industry-owned study report”. UKTAG had seen summaries, but hadn’t had access to the full report.\n\n“UKTAG does not routinely request study reports owned by industry, as these are proprietary information and may contain trade secrets or confidential commercial information that the study owners claim exempt them from public disclosure,” the memo said.”\n\nLooks to me like someone is trying to sabotage the Scottish farmed salmon industry, in favour of wild salmon industries elsewhere. This makes both industries look terrible. Isn’t it possible to reduce stocking or expand size, to where naturally, fewer lice become an issue? \n\nUsually when I read things like this, I am concerned about the practical matters, like ‘why do you need to feed salmon insecticide’. And ‘why do the fish get lice?’ And ‘do they get lice everywhere?’ And ‘are lice natural or were they introduced by mistake or deliberately?’ And ‘why would lice be a problem, most often there are thousands of pests that are naturally found in healthy wild populations, in low numbers’.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon_louse\n\nIt seems it’s difficult to manage in existing farms with species that are susceptible to it. They seem to have been trialling lasers as a control measure. \n\nI think they already use synthetic chemicals to colour the salmon.\n\nhttps://wildalaskancompany.com/blog/heres-why-salmon-are-pink-orange-or-red\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/astaxanthin\n\nSomething missing was if the lice pose any threat to humans, or if it’s all image, fear and stress. After reading the Wikipedia article I guess the issue is more that when the salmon are contained, there are many more lice eggs, that creates problems elsewhere. \n\n“The infestations of sea lice in salmon farms increases the number of lice in the rest of the surrounding water dramatically if the eggs from the gravid louse are allowed to disperse.”\n\nAnd \n\n“In 2016 Guardian news stated that the lice killed thousands of tonnes of farmed fish, caused skin lesions and secondary infections in millions more”\n\nI suppose the skin lesions are an issue?",

That means more of the tree is used to do so and doesn't become waste. It becomes more efficient so that with less trees planted per acre you have more. \n\nNow as far as breeding with natural stocks I agree with you, this should be averted. For that you need more genetic modification, but the problem then becomes the supply coming from a single source that had the work of producing this GMOs and market control.\n\nI think we will need GMOs in the future and that doesn't need to be a bad thing. But for that you need to demand tight regulation, you need to vote for the people that care about the issue.

I made some back-of-the-envelope calculations with ChatGPT not so long ago, and it seems that dedicating just a few percent of the animal agriculture lands (<6%) would be able to completely replace our need for wood in paper and cellulose production.\n\nThis is a summary of the discussion. I haven't fact-checked it yet; if somebody wants full transcript and help with that, please pm me.\n\n---\n\nHemp, a sustainable alternative to wood, matures in four months and yields up to four times more paper per acre compared to trees. Hemp paper production is also environmentally friendly, with less harmful chemicals involved.\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization's 2020 Global Forest Resources Assessment estimates 3.99 billion cubic meters of wood was harvested in 2018. This includes industrial roundwood (48%, or about 1.93 billion cubic meters), used for construction, furniture, paper, and packaging, and woodfuel (52%).\n\nIndustrial roundwood consists of sawlogs and veneer logs (65-75%), pulpwood (20-30%) for paper production, and other uses (5-10%) such as in chemicals and bioplastics. To replace 3 billion cubic meters of wood with hemp, we consider the average yield of hemp straw (5 to 15 tons per hectare annually).\n\nAssuming a conservative yield of 10 tons per hectare, with 30% fiber and 70% hurd, and average wood density of 550 kg/m³, the target mass to replace wood would be 1,650 billion kg. Hence, 165 million hectares of land would be needed to grow the required hemp.\n\nCurrently, 3.97 billion hectares (38.5% of the world's land) is used for agriculture, with 70% or 2.79 billion hectares used for animal agriculture. The land required for hemp cultivation represents about 5.9% of the land used for animal agriculture, or approximately 4.2% of the total agricultural land.",

As proposed by members of the Citizens Convention for Climate in 2019, and specified in the 2021 Climate and Resilience Act, the government is required to present a \"national strategy for food, nutrition and climate\" (SNANC), in theory before July 1, but all observers agree that this timetable will not be met. Originally, this requirement was intended to avoid compartmentalized sectoral measures and cover the environment, health and food.\n\nAlthough the general public has hardly heard of the SNANC acronym, there are already high expectations of the strategy, and there is pressure for a clear way forward. Some economic stakeholders are worried, fearing new constraints.\n\nWhile the government has not yet revealed any of its decisions, the various camps are anxious about what's to come. In the latest clash on Monday, May 15 – 70 environmental and public health organizations, consumer associations, health professionals and learned societies published an open letter to Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, asking for SNANC to \"clearly state ambitious and precise objectives for the transition of our food\" and \"plan structural policies throughout the food chain,\" making access to sustainable food for all a priority.\n\nSuch a united front is rare. From the Climate Action Network (RAC) to UFC-Que choisir, the French Federation of Diabetics to the League against Cancer, the French Public Health Society to the Young Doctors Union and the French Association of Dieticians-Nutritionists – all are calling on the government \"to resist the pressure of certain agricultural and agri-food lobbies and to follow the recommendations shared by scientists and civil society so that SNANC can meet the challenges of ecology, social justice and public health.\" Specifically, they are calling for the strategy to be more than a vague text and to include real tools and measures to improve the food supply and environment.\n\n**The divisions of the National Food Council (CNA)**\n\n\"The scope of this strategy will depend on the decisions that will be made very soon by the prime minister,\" explained Benoît Granier, food director at the RAC. \"It should not be yet another plan among many, but a constructive strategy that sets objectives and creates concrete tools to achieve them, which can then be done by regulations or laws.\" These civil society organizations are hoping in particular for measures to regulate the environment and the food supply, such as banning advertisements for products that are the most damaging to health and the environment.\n\nThis idea is particularly pushed by the CNA, an independent advisory body, which presented the government with an opinion adopted on April 5. In this, the CNA proposes 17 objectives that could serve as a basis for the development of SNANC. This opinion was hotly debated, as confirmed by the final document, which contains several dissents. For example, the national federation of unions of agricultural businesses (FNSEA), La Coopération Agricole (LCA) and five other members of the CNA are opposed to the wording: \"moderating the supply of meat and dairy products\" in the distributive sector, and say they prefer \"the notion of dietary balance between plant and animal products.\" Similarly, the National Food Industry Association (ANIA), FNSEA, LCA and two other representatives disagree with the idea of \"regulating the marketing and advertising of products that run counter to a balanced, healthy and sustainable diet\" and prefer \"a voluntary framework.\" In all, half the objectives set out by CNA are opposed by some of its members, which raises fears that the government may be reluctant to put forward ambitious goals.\n\n**You can read the article in full by clicking on this link:** https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2023/05/15/in-france-pressure-mounts-for-the-government-to-present-a-sustainable-food-transition-strategy\\_6026673\\_7.html",

As for the comments regarding gas, everyone produces about 1 liter of flatulence a day, it's normal. Maybe people want to focus especially on that aspect the day after eating beans so they can use it as affirmation for why they shouldn't be eating beans.   \n\n\nThere's actually a reason we eat so many beans and it's a financial one. A pound of dried beans costs from under $1 up to $10, once soaked and cooked, we have about 3 pounds of beans and portions for between 4 and 6 meals, lunch or dinner. Mind you, this isn't due to a poverty situation but if out of the 1095 meals we eat per year, we eat beans 120 times, we save about $1200 per year on food costs. We travel between 60 and 80 days per year for pleasure and not all of those journeys are long vacations, we simply put a greater value on where we go and what we can do away from home.

I’ve read a lot of Michael Pollan’s stuff and I just started reading Upton Sinclair’s, “The Jungle,” and I have become re-radicalized in many ways.\n\nMy diet is ever shifting as I shop at a wide variety of stores, including a lot of ethnic grocery stores (Indian, East Asian, Halal, Italian Importing Warehouse that is local), and I buy local whenever possible. Food has become so expensive, and I will not compromise on quality if I can afford it; one of the things I see a lot more of now than I did before is a lot of perimortem injuries to poultry, which is very off-putting, and I will not consume. The whole thing has put me off meat for the most part, save for the locally grown, raised, slaughtered options. I keep chickens and I haven’t the grit yet to use my own birds for food, but I use their eggs and treat them well.\n\nEggs and beans have featured heavily in our diet lately, and I expect it only to increase with time as our protein source; everyone in the house is on board with whatever I cook. \n\nAlso, I highly recommend exploring grains other than wheat. We don’t have gluten here because 1 of us is intolerant, and our diet became so much more varied when I began experimenting with different flours. I love making Indian food with chick pea flour, (and it makes a great flour to use for batter for eggplant parm). \n\nFor what it’s worth, I learned just yesterday that Pythagoras and his followers did not eat beans and we don’t know the reasoning anymore but it was a thing.

Eating lentils does not exclude you. I believe that we need to understand and drastically improve all our practices. Good grazing practices for grass fed beef increases soil organic matter (carbon sink) and soil health year after year. It also uses almost no fossil fuels, very little fertilizer, and no pesticides. Grazing ruminants also helps encourage habitat for wildlife like songbirds, predatory birds, rodents, and small prey animals. The only downside is methane. None of these things are true growing lentils.  There is a lot of merit in the production of vegetable protein sources, but the practices need to be improved to prevent soil organic matter depletion and reduce the use of pesticides.

It also requires more land and takes longer to raise the cattle. So we are gonna have to eat more legumes in any case.

Way less CO2 goes into production of a bike. And I get 65mpg on top of that.\n\nRealistically hybrid sports bikes are gonna be the answer. They have crazy specs for riders who like to go for a track day or spirited cruise and they extend the range for long-distance travel. They look really promising.\n\nThere are some really interesting hybrid concepts that Kawasaki is pushing. It’s not on the market right now, but it’s hybrid gas/electric (on a ninja 600 platform) that uses electric motors for acceleration and low end speed. But, it uses ICE for cruising and top end where electric is less capable. Ignoring the 100+mpg, the bike would have crazy torque and acceleration from the electric aspect and the ICE could be tuned for more top speed. In the next 5 years we could see extremely capable hybrid sports bikes. We could easily be seeing 2.5-3.0 sec 0-60 times, 5-6 sec 0-100 times and still be able to hit top end speeds of 180+.

Up until sometime in the 1800s, though, lobster was literally low-class food, eaten only by the poor and institutionalized. Even in the harsh penal environment of early America, some colonies had laws against feeding lobsters to inmates more than once a week because it was thought to be cruel and unusual, like making people eat rats. One reason for their low status was how plentiful lobsters were in old New England. \"Unbelievable abundance is how one source describes the situation, including accounts of Plymouth pilgrims wading out and capturing all they wanted by hand, and of early Boston's seashore being littered with lobsters after hard storms these latter were treated as a smelly nuisance and ground up for fertilizer. There is also the fact that premodern lobster was often cooked dead and then preserved, usually packed in salt or crude hermetic containers. Maine's earliest lobster industry was based around a dozen such seaside canneries in the 1840s, from which lobster was shipped as far away as California, in demand only because it was cheap and high in protein, basically chewable fuel.\nNow, of course, lobster is posh, a delicacy, only a step or two down from caviar. The meat is richer and more substantial than most fish, its taste subtle compared to the marine-gaminess of mussels and clams. In the U.S. pop-food imagination, lobster is now the seafood analog to steak, with which it's so often twinned as Surf 'n' Turf on the really expensive part of the chain steak house menu.”",

Critics have even decried ESG strategies as needlessly “woke.”\n\nAll of which raises a couple of important questions: What are ESG investments exactly?

Even though it is a fraction of their profit they're doing more for renewable energy investment than many actual renewable companies because of their large market cap. We have to understand that BP, like any other company in a capitalist society, operates because of profit incentive. BP is evil because it's capitalist, but why try to change BP (which won't be going ANYWHERE) when we should blame our leaders for not incentivizing renewables enough. BP will follow the profit if the government incentivizes it. Plus, if we destroy the oil companies, who's gonna replace all of the existing infrastructure and real estate they've built up with their gas stations? They could easily retrofit gasoline pumps into EV chargers whereas a purely renewable energy company doesn't have that ability. It's best to think practically rather than ideally when we don't really have a lot of time to fix this. BP will change with policy change not the other way around. Plus, for those who think there aren't insane profit margins in renewables: just look at what happened in Ireland in the last 5-10 years solar was like a gold rush out there and it was whoever could get the land and infrastructure first that profited the most. Oil is a finite resource and this has insane profit margins, but people forget that the infrastructure for renewables is also finite, even though the energy source itself is not. \n\nTL;DR the fastest way to mitigate oil's impact on climate the change is to put the pressure on our politicians and try to continuously nudge the oil companies towards renewables through protest, not abandon them entirely",

[Source is the IPCC report, graph 1.5](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/graphics/#cid_455)\n\nThere's confusion in this topic because stabilizing the concentration of c02 in the atmosphere (a stop in c02eq increases) does not immediately stabilize global temperature. The confusion is solved when you realize that (human) net zero implies (global) net negative (from ocean and vegetation absorptions). It's slightly more complicated because net zero would imply in net aerosols, but the math still checkouts to no additional warming as soon as net zero is attained.

The reason why batteries became popular isn't due to storage, that is a side gig, their main use is grid services, something no other technology can do as well as they don't have under 16-20ms response time needed.\n\nAs for bio energy, I will remind you the goal isn't gross zero but net zero.

In 2010, their emissions was 82 gCO2e, so over a decade and their emissions aren't going down but up, and so far only commitment to net zero is 2050\n\nAs for why not nuclear:\n\nYou would think being low on emissions would make it easy to hit net zero even by 2025 for France, but the problem is nuclear lacks flexibility and makes it hard to use it with renewables. Thus its difficult to hit net zero with just nuclear and it getting in the way of renewables isn't helping\n\nThen there is the cost issue, while renewables continue to get cheaper, nuclear is only getting more expensive as more issues crop up in real life\n\nThere isn't enough nuclear expertise to deploy nuclear en-mass, even if every country put all their energy investments into nuclear today, it would be impossible to hit net zero even by 2050\n\nNobody is going to be building nuclear en mass for 3rd world countries, are you going to sell nuclear reactors to Iran and Iraq? If they can even afford it. In the meantime, every time renewable prices half, the whole world gets closer to net zero. Because there is no problem selling solar panels and wind turbines to Iran or Iraq or any 3rd world country, and as it gets cheaper it becomes more easily affordable. They can even build their own with time\n\nNuclear also needs lots of water, which doesn't help current situation of increased heatwaves where water is becoming more scarce(This of course applies to all Thermal power plants)\n\nThen of course there are the nuclear leaks issues and the nuclear waste issue",

Think a 1 way spillway that allows a tide to run high volumes of water into a catchment, then hydro gen while its flowing out at low tide. Tides arent as binary as we would like to hope though, the lunar day shows 2 high tides but one is higher than the other so what height do you put the spillway at to capture high tide? Other studies Ive read say ideal height is 600-800ft altitude gain is ideal for PSH to get enough pressure to generate grid scale power. If theres only 2-5 ft of altitude difference to work with its not enough to turn hydro generators for high output. That said a lot of static reservoirs that are recharged by rivers generate good power with just 50-300ft of depth. Watching Lake Mead for example we can see that as the water level drops the total output from the generators goes down, they still get water, its just less pressure. On the other hand the Bay of Fundy has the highest tide in the world and theoretically if we could capture all the energy from that tidal range we could power ... possibly all of humanity or at least a whole country. https://fundyforce.ca/",

And continues to resurface as new information is gotten in the investigations.\n\nYou overestimate the attention span of US media. This isn't Russia where they go on about the same thing for years on end cause they have nothing. The US media would forget Ukraine war happens the moment a celeb slaps another celeb unless something new happens. The US audience simply lacks attention span for repeat of same news.\n\nAnd no, Biden did not say anything of the sort, please stop spreading Russian propaganda. If you actually watched the entire thing and not a clip out of context and know where and when the soundbite was taken from. Biden said that if Ukraine was invaded, he would get Nordstream 2 cancelled (Note the attack took out Nordstream 1, where only 1 pipeline of Nordstream 2 was harmed, the other Nordstream 2 pipeline was not. How convenient for Russia right? The pipeline they had a contract for destroyed and pipeline that contract was not finalized still capable). Anyways, the reporter then asks Biden how he could cancel the Nordstream 2 pipeline if it isn't up to US anymore and up to Germany. To which he responds \"We\" as in US working with Germany(who was in the room next to him at the time) would stop the pipeline. Aka, what he is talking about is that Germany who the pipeline goes to has the authority to cancel the pipeline, and he is saying Germany is with us on this. Nothing about destroying any pipeline.\n\nI swear, some of you Russians, if Putin were to kill your whole family right in front of you, you'd still say it wasn't his fault.(Just like with Stalin).

In other words, rich people tended to take advantage of others primarily because they saw selfish and greedy behavior as acceptable, not just because they had more money or higher social status.\n>\n>To confirm this, another experiment examined whether a person’s attitudes about greed or his class status would predict cheating on a dice game. Researchers recruited 195 adults on Craigslist, queried them about their backgrounds and greedy attitudes, and then had them play a computerized dice game in which higher rolled scores meant a higher chance of winning $50. Unbeknownst to them, the computer always generated the same score: 12. People who believed greed was good were more likely to cheat and report inflated scores of 15 or higher.\n>\n>Then, in a final study in which the researchers primed participants by having them talk about either the benefits of greed or something neutral (what they did that day), they found that poor participants were just as likely as rich ones — if they were primed to think greed was good — to support bribery or to cheat unsuspecting customers.

                "body": "Oh man, do I have some questions about this study. This study seems a bit sus to me, because I don't think it's a good way to gauge greed. \n\n1st let's examine the dice game. Since we don't have the background information on the participants (maybe it's listed in the study but I don't have it) so let's give the researchers the benefit of the doubt and say it was evenly split between poor, middle-class, and rich (since the people were answering a craigslist add, I honestly don't believe that the sample size included a lot of rich people and noone that would consider themselves part of the 0.01%). \n\nIf the participant was someone that was really poor, and only answered the ad because they didn't have enough money to buy food for their family, is it \"greedy\" to lie about the number rolled for a chance, not even a guarantee, to win 50 dollars? And by making it a CHANCE, instead of a guarantee the person is more likely to lie. Wouldn't it be normal and rational to believe that since they are broke that they have more of a right to the money than a rich person? \n\nA middle-class participant would have a similar mindset. Most people in the middle-class are on tight budgets, they may know where their next meal is coming from, but they can't go to the store and drop 50 dollars on a luxury item. And since it's, once again, only a chance to win, the incentive for lying is higher than it would be otherwise. Is that greedy though? \n\nA rich person doesn't need the money, but they probably value their time. And the more money you have the more you believe that your time is worth more than other people's. Plus, have you ever seen a rich person in a casino? Or at bingo?  By making the reward a chance instead of a guarantee it makes it a game for them. If they were told that by lying they would be taking food from the mouth of a child would they exhibit the same greedy behavior? \n\nSo, imo, the dice game isn't a good indicator. Also, how does age factor into the results? It's been my personal experience that someone in their min 20s to early 40s is going to have more empathy because they have kids or remember their own struggles. The older you get the more out of touch you become. Older people tend to compare everything to when they were younger and refuse to consider how much things have changed (not everyone but way too many). \n\nAnd finally, let's look at the bribery piece of the study. We don't know what scenario they were given, so I'll make up my own: \n\nScenario 1 - Consider you worked in a government office and were often offered bribes. You've been there for several years and the only time you have received a raise was when they raised minimum wage. New employees are hired with a higher wage because they have more experience or education. It's well known that bribery is common in your office and all throughout government. Your coworkers are driving expensive cars and living in nice houses. You know that they often take bribes. Would you be more likely to take a bribe if you worked in that office? \n\nI think most people would say yes. Even if you're well off you would probably still take the bribe because it's normal, everyone is doing it. Would that be greedy though? \n\nScenario - 2 You're a server at a restaurant and only make 3 dollars an hour. Customers offer you bribes to provide better service. Would it be wrong to take that bribe? Even if the entire industry was build on customers providing bribes? Would you take a bribe in that situation? If it was called a tip instead of bribe does that make it okay? \n\nAnd no, I'm not excusing the restaurant owners that only pay their servers a few dollars an hour, nor am I trying to say that rich people aren't too greedy. I'm just saying that the study doesn't make a lot of sense. \n\nI think it is common in the US and many other western countries for people to do what's in their best interest, financially. We've abandoned the idea of community and doing things for the common good. \n\nI guess my point is that we're all a little greedy depending on the situation. If I go through a drive through at a restaurant because I don't want to pay someone a tip, I guess that's a bit greedy. At no point do I stop and consider that the tip might help out a server that has less than me. I only know that I don't want to tip 4 bucks at an overpriced fast food restaurant.",

                "body": "I'm atheist, so no, not a religious belief. That comment is also very reductive. \n\nGiven the right set of circumstances everyone is greedy, to say otherwise is idealistic. And the paper you linked supports my claim: \n\n\"they found that poor participants were just as likely as rich ones — if they were primed to think greed was good — to support bribery or to cheat unsuspecting customers\"\n\nI also believe that given the right circumstances that everyone is also generous.  Also supported by the paper. \n\nI'm going to get a bit off track but stay with me, and hopefully you'll see what I mean about my issues with this study.\n\nDebates about greed and morality go back more than 2500 years. The Greek philosopher Protagoras believed that morality, which included greed, was based on the environment where a person was raised. Every idea, thought and action a person ever had in their lifetime was built on a foundation laid by every interaction they had with others in their community (things people read and experience are included).\n\nPlato, on the other hand, disagreed with that philosophy. He believed that morality was an inherent trait, i.e. everyone was born already knowing right from wrong. Although, he did admit that some people were broken and were amoral from birth (someone like a psychopath). \n\nThe truth is somewhere in-between those opposing beliefs. Morality, causing others pain, physical or emotional, is a trait developed in most species through natural selection. Tribes that shared resources were more likely to survive, so morality developed naturally. \n\nBut morality is also shaped by your environment. There was a paper in 2006 that became famous because it studied London cab drivers and demonstrated how their brains were different to that of the average person. The \"direction\" part of their amygdala was significantly more pronounced than the control subjects. They drove so much that it created physical changes to their brains.  \n\nBut that was only a small part of the study. One of the primary focuses of the paper had to do with how language can also change the amygdala. If, for instance, someone repeatedly hears the phrase \"greed is good\" then eventually their innate morality will start to be over written. Physically overwritten. \n\nThe more money someone has the more disconnected they become from their environment. A rich person is less likely to give to a homeless person because of that disconnection. They have been repeatedly told that homeless people aren't human, they're \"trash,\" or \"scum.\"  Same thing happens when rich people talk about poor people, whether intentional or not, they dehumanize them. The people who are living paycheck to paycheck are failures and it's their own fault. It's okay to rip them off because they deserve it.\n\nOr worse yet, the rich person may have been subjected to the prosperity gospel and honestly believe that they are successful because that's what God wants. They're special. They are told that over and over and that's why they are okay screwing people over. \n\nSo, habits and morals are affected physically by environment and language, but that's not what this paper set out to prove (probably because it had already been proven over a decade ago.) In other words, being a rich asshole probably happens because you spend a lot of time around other rich assholes. The things you choose to read are written by other rich assholes, rich assholes gravitate towards shows with rich assholes. Rich assholes teach their kids rich asshole things. You get it. \n\nWhen the researchers of the paper were studying the driving habit of the rich verses the poor, at no point does anyone stop to question whether the poor people are more careful with their cars because a 500/1000 dollar deductible for someone living paycheck to paycheck is a huge burden. The poor and middle-class are also less likely to have insurance that provides a car rental in the event your car is undrivable. Even the temporary loss of a vehicle would have dire consequences. \n\nThe rich guy is less likely to take care their vehicle unless given a reason. The newest sedan is only a tool, but put then behind the wheel of a car they love, don't you think they are going to be just as careful as a person driving a jalopy around? Not everyone will have this attitude, as Plato said, some people are just born broken. \n\nAnother example from the paper referred to how rich people were less likely to help someone entering the lab in distress. Once again, this could be due to how a person was raised. A rich person is less likely to do things on their own, it could be that the participants didn't jump to help because they didn't know how. \n\nAnd then there is the whole issue with \"priming.\" The paper doesn't say how people were \"primed\" which is why there was a lot of conjecture in my first post. I gave examples of ways to prime people to get them to act in ways that were greedy and amoral. I also showed that a act that most will find \"greedy,\" taking bribes, is perfectly acceptable if you just change your point of view--instead of calling something a bribe just call it tipping instead. \n\nThe link you posted was to an article about the paper so there are a lot of missing pieces. It's possible that my issues stem from how the author chose to write the article, but if I were to read the actual study I may change my opinion. \n\nI don't disagree that rich people are more greedy, I just disagree with how the paper went about proving that theory. ",

The problem rn is our “growth mindset” our gdp must grow because economy good, but the problem is “material use” is strictly following gdp. So infinite gdp growth means infinite material use, which we know is impossible, but yet we seek infinite growth anyways.\n\nHaving “clean” energy may have the unintended consequence of allowing us to recklessly grow GDP even more, in which historistically (even with increase in service industry)m proportionally increase material use which results in us damaging the ecosystem more. Ideally we want to use the clean energy as a stepping stone, but most importantly we need to stop “growing” and start cutting back.\n\nSo how can you help? Join climate activists, work and volunteer for movements that protect ecology and cleanups, argue for degrowth. \n\nSource for material use and GDP: https://content.csbs.utah.edu/~mli/Economics%207004/HickelandKallis-IsGreenGrowthPossible.pdf\n\nRecc video for the subject that further explains my points: https://youtu.be/uCuy1DaQzWI",

The cause is too many people demanding too much from ecosystems, or human overshoot of the biophysical carrying capacity of the Earth.\n\n> ...\n\n> A report for the Brookings Institution states that wind and solar require 10 times more land per unit of power produced than coal- or natural gas-fired power plants, a figure that takes into account the land torn up and habitat destroyed in order to drill out, pump, and transport fossil fuels. “Renewable power production,” the report states matter-of-factly, “will take place in areas that have not seen energy development.”\n\n> There is also the global scale of mining needed to extract and process the lithium, nickel, cobalt, rare earths, and other necessities for renewables infrastructure. The net result: Decarbonizing will likely lead to huge fragmentation of land, in the U.S. and overseas, particularly in minerals-rich China and the “global south.” And not just wildlife will be affected: The “death villages” around the Bayan Obo mine in China, source of 70 percent of the world’s rare earths, are testament to the health cost of green-tech mining, which is only going to accelerate in pace and scale.",

The way our current energy system is set up, demand and supply need to be matched at all times in order to avoid wide scale outages. In order to mitigate the intermittency, we need energy generation that is easy to ramp production up or down, for example nuclear or gas. In essence you could use other \"burnable\" energy carriers, e.g. hydrogen, but those are still produced from natural gas, so that will only ensure efficiency losses.\n\nNow long term nuclear is a very good option to perform this task, however, there is nearly not enough nuclear capacity in Europe to cover all of the variability, thus we need some other source. For this purpose, gas is the best option as of now.\n\nSo why name it green, well that's just a policy decision, to make it possible to keep investing in gas based power generation. No one actually believes gas is green.\n\nTLDR; gas is not green, but it performs a task that no other green alternative can perform on the same scale and efficiency as gas plants can do, therefore we need them the coming decades.",

The waste the waste left by this process is very small in comparison and is non nuclear. It creates an inner substance that you can simply bury in the dirt and cause no negative issues. We have had the solution to energy problems since before World War II . What's fascinating to me is that the group that doesn't care about the environment is all for nuclear because it's a new innovative and efficient method of energy. However, the people that claim to care about the planet are pushing things that not only don't work (wind, solar, hydro, etc)  But also have a horrible  Toll on the Earth to get the resources to build the implements needed. Nuclear material farming is as bad as anything else and it lasts insanely long. Hong. The best energy source is thorium salt reactors. Do you want a good example look at fukashima. They had one of the worst tsunamis and 1 of the worst earthquakes in Japanese History . And the center of the damage was the Fukushima nuclear facility. The only people who died were older individuals that were harmed due to the evacuation and there was no  Radiation issues and the issues And the facility was repaired. If. If we follow that design it doesn't matter what happens those facilities are stable there's no reason to invest in anything else at least right now while we have the answer that will work for the next 10000 years",

No representative democracy has come anywhere close to taking the necessary emergency action to end fossil fuels through more than 3 decades of elections. 30 years of voting, lobbying, letter writing, donating, emailing and peaceful marches have summed up to one point in history:\n\npolite, respectable ABJECT FAILURE on the climate and ecological crisis.\n\nOn the other hand, the historical and sociological evidence is very strong that nonviolent civil resistance wins radical political change, very rapidly, in dozens of case histories, in societies across the world, for the last hundred years or so.\n\nThe lives and livliehoods of thousands of millions of people are on the line. The continued existence of the US as a relatively prosperous, free and democratic country is on the line. The climate crisis is the greatest crime, the greatest moral obscenity, in human history. We are in a crisis that demands emergency action!\n\nBlocking roads in great numbers is how people around the world force radical political change all the time over the last hundred years.\n\nIn Puerto Rico they just forced the governor to resign by blocking roads.\n\nIn Chile they are re-writing their Constitution because the people forced a referendum by blocking roads.\n\nIn Serbia they brought down the violent dictator Slobodan Milosevic by blocking roads, same with Ferdinand Marcos in the Phillipines.\n\nBlocking roads in mass numbers does indeed force the positive political change, over and over, across the world. It's the same principle as a labor strike- ordinary people acting in mass have the power to force government to a halt until their demands are met.\n\nThe strategy is sound. It requires mass participation to win. So, what excuse do you have for not getting in the road to demand emergency climate action?\n\nGo to www.DeclareEmergency.org to sign up! Organizers are planning, mobilizing and training volunteers to shut down highways in the nation's capital to demand emergency climate action now. The next 1000 generations are counting on us.",

They're hard to recycle, and hard to dispose of properly beyond just digging a hole and shoving them in. There are companies who have put their scientists on dealing with these issues, but as of now we have no good solution.\n\nAlso they both require vast landmasses to produce a lot of power. Maybe one day we'll for example invent solar panels that can get much more efficient at getting energy out of sunlight so we wouldn't need quite so many of them. But we're not there yet.\n\nHydro has the problem of damming up rivers which is more than troubling for fish. Here in Norway some \"wise\" men made the decision to dam up thousands of small rivers instead of a few larges ones, so now we got literally thousands of small dams that more or less function as blenders for fish. Because they didn't build all of them with alternate routes for fish, so they have to go through the blender in many cases.\n\nNuclear has the waste, but the amount of waste produced by modern reactors is miniscule. With deep deposits inside stable mountain structures we won't have to worry about that for many generations.

And the people were killed by shrapnel, not radiation (though they would certainly have died of their radiation exposure). What happened there is that the control rod was pulled out MUCH too far and the reactor got so hot so fast that all the water in the reactor vessel immediately turned to steam. It went something that is called prompt critical, which will take some explaining. Critical simply means that the reaction is self-sustaining. The water in pressurized water reactors acts as both a coolant and a moderator. See, U-235 is what is called a slow fuel. It prefers to absorb slow (relatively) neutrons. So, a moderator is needed to slow down the neutrons that are released by fission. It WILL sometimes absorb neutrons that have not been slowed down, though. Fast critical means that enough neutrons that have not been slowed down are being absorbed by the U-235 to sustain the reaction. Meaning that the neutrons which have been slowed down are just speeding up the reaction rate. Which means that the core got really hot, really fast. When the water turned to steam, the pressure in the reactor vessel increased way above the designed maximum pressure of the reactor vessel, which failed catastrophically.",

I work on energy issues in Europe, and the trajectory and speed of change to RES +storage, interconnection, and efficiency has been obvious to everyone in the industry for years.\n\n>Do those even provide in the same ballpark as what will be needed? \n\nYes. You'd be surprised how *relatively* little storage is needed with a proper interconnected grid and more efficient usage (still a lot, but very achievable with Europe's current hydro potential alone for example).\n\n>Pumped hydro has the potential for a large amount of individual storage but it's not scalable and geographically limited. \n\nPumped hydro is just as, if not more, scalable and less geographically limited than nuclear - especially when you take into account the social licence problems and cooling needs of nuclear (France is already bracing for more shutdowns this year because of drought-prone rivers not being able to support its nukes). SMRs are more resilient to these issues, but not part of any serious energy discussion at  this stage as they are too far off practicality. \n\n>Cars are widespread but each only has enough energy to power a home for about 3-4 days with rationing, going 100-0. \n\nWith tens of millions of EVs on the road already, and momentum to make all new cars EVs (again, in Europe) by 2035, the potential size of a distributed V2G battery is enormous, and there will never be a situation where no renewables, hydro, or geothermal is not producing enough over a wide enough geographic area to leave car owners with 0% charge. That's also assuming a system where owners even allow that. Allowing anyone to sell into the grid will be a gamechanger for the transition frankly, and will supercharge renewable rollouts and overbuild once people see what this could mean for their energy costs.\n\n>I have trouble imagining a scenario where solar/wind/storage makes more than a small part of the energy mix without being vulnerable for disruptions. \n\nAgain, take a look at what's happening in Europe. RES is already providing huge shares of national consumption in a host of countries without issue. Portugal, Germany, Spain, Greece, Nordics etc etc. National circumstances change, and the percentages go up and down, but Europe is figuring this shit out super fast. No one will be arguing about this by 2025.\n\n>For example the 2020 wildfires in California: We got extremely lucky that the smoke didn't spread roughly 100 miles West, where most of CA's solar generation resides.\n\nNuclear/coal/gas/oil plants are not immune to wildfires or extreme weather either. A major coal transit line in Australia has been destroyed this week because of biblical floods.\n\n>Firm generation is just too essential to modern life to let it ever go out. Especially as we electrify our homes and climate change gets more extreme (in weather but also both higher and lower temperature extremes). \n\nThis is the \"baseload\" argument, and it's a myth. Yes of course you need backup and storage with RES, but with more distrubution and local generation you get less points of critical failure, and a fairer more affordable system overall, where people have a chance to control their own energy sources should they want to.",

Many recent delays come down project specific politics and technical challenges, but extrapolating those outliers to the entire industry is ridiculous.\n\nAs for grid storage you seriously underestimate how difficult it is going to be. NREL reports put US grid storage requirements for 94% renewables at an optimistic [930 GW capacity for 6.5 hours](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy22osti/80688.pdf), and that includes hydro and more dispatchable renewables like biofuels. The US currently has 43 pumped hydro facilities with a combined 22 GW power output, Battery storage adds another \\~6-7 GW capacity. So we will need \\~1700+ pumped hydro plants. Even if we are able to convert some existing dams to pumped storage we would still be building thousands of new dams. This also does not take into account the locations of these pumped hydro plants since you cant build it just anywhere. The western US may not have too much difficulty with this but the midwest and parts of the south and east might. This would then require very significant high voltage transmission infrastructure to be built, much larger than what we currently have. And if it is going to happen any time soon it would need to be majority pumped hydro, we can only add 4-5 GW of battery capacity each year at present.\n\nMeanwhile nuclear plants can be constructed in a decade and have very few geographical restraints. They might not make sense past a certain percentage of the grid and that is where renewables and storage come in. If nuclear provides 40-50% of the grids energy the amount of storage needed drops from 930 GW to 278 GW which is more realistic.",

Most of construction of a nuclear power plant is reinforced concrete and plumbing. In terms of construction it has a lot of similarities with a hydro project, but ultimately generates much more energy for a given amount of input material and manpower.\n\nAs for how many would be needed, the US currently has 55 nuclear power plants with 93 reactors and they provide 20% of the energy. So another 50 plants or so with about 100 reactors is all that is required. That is significantly less than 1700+ pumped hydro projects along with adding ~7x our current amount of solar and wind (3% and 9% of US electricity respectively). \n\nIt is absolutely possible, and it has already been done. France built the majority of their nuclear power plants in a 10-15 year period and they make up 70% of Frances electricity production. No large country has built up anywhere near that much solar/wind in any timescale. Outside of hydro, renewables have not made much of a dent in global energy generation, they still lag behind nuclear despite countries abandoning it as a power source and investing heavily in renewables over the past decade, and that includes essentially no storage.

All clean electricity sources generated 38% of the world’s electricity in 2021, more than coal (36%).*\r  \n\r  \n*To be on a pathway that keeps global heating to 1.5 degrees, wind and solar need to sustain high compound growth rates of 20% every year to 2030. That’s the same rate of growth as their average over the last decade.* \n\nCan RES and storage get us 100% of the way? Technically I think it's very possible with what's coming online commercially this decade, but does it need to?

Also, my gasoline car cost me about $10,000 and will last for a very long. A low-cost electric car will cost at least twice that and won't last nearly as long. In fact with the mileage I've put on my gas car in the last 4 years I would be nearly halfway through the battery life of an average brand new electric car, I still have about 150,000 miles before my current car is going to give out and it's pre-used.\n\nIn addition to this:\n\n1. solar works when it's sunny and requires a lot of land to operate on. The materials used to make solar panels require rare-earth minerals typically found through strip-mining. Solar cannot deal with fluctuations in demand since we cannot make the sun brighter.\n2. wind works when it's windy and requires just as much if not more land to operate on. It's also harmful to large (usually endangered) birds. The turbines also don't last as long and are not recycled so they take up a lot of landfill space when they run out. Wind cannot deal with fluctuations in demand since we cannot make it windier.\n3. Hydro requires the destruction of natural habitats but is rather reliable until a major drought. Hydro has some ability to cope with fluctuations in demand.\n4. Coal and oil are very reliable and can deal with fluctuations in demand since we can simply add more to the fire.\n5. But nuclear is the safest, cleanest, most efficient, and most reliable source out of all of this.\n\nEdit: For clarity, I want to add that I'm not against moving away from coal and oil. I just don't think that solar and wind are going to cut it.",

It is a sector strongly regulated by governments.

The cheapest one made within the last 5 years was about $18,000 and the cheapest within the last 2 is still $40,000.\n\nLook, I'm not trying to say that EVs are bad and shouldn't be used or made. Just that right now, they are infeasible to a lot of people due to cost and how long they take to fill up. I'll gladly switch when they are more affordable to me and able to get me where I need to go reliably, I just live too far away from many of the places I have to visit regularly for the cheapest EV to be feasible and there are a lot of people in my same situation.\n\nMy point is that if you have to worry about the gas that costs $5 a gallon, the solution isn't to wait a few years to buy a $20,000 vehicle, nor is it to buy the cheapest EV in existence now. Ultimately, I think that the goal should be 100% EVs, but it's going to take a long time, perhaps another decade, for that to happen because EVs have a significantly higher upfront cost and most of the people who won't transition to EVs sooner, can't because of that cost.",

My anecdotal example is the Subaru Crosstrek.  $26K for base gas model, $39K for hybrid (I've seen as low as $37K, and as high as $45K).  $3K down in both cases, & I understand a hybrid is not a true 'EV'.  Financing a $23K gas car ($375/mth) vs a $36K hybrid ($605/mth) is vastly different.  Filing up a 13 gal gas car twice a month is ~ $150 - still almost $100 less.  And I can taper my driving habits as needed - can't adjust static constraints like a monthly payment / funds available for a down payment.\n\nThe maintenance savings are great, I hadn't previously thought about that!  I think it's something like $330/year ($28/mth) ... but insuring an EV car costs 15% more, so it's somewhat negated.  Ditto for excise tax.  Why is everything insurance related always 15% /s?!?\n\nThen you run into the availability issue: what's available on the lot vs how long you have to / can wait for your new car.  Like I really liked what Ford did with the Maverick - hybrid small truck, good entry price point ... But then they didn't have any in stock /3-month backorder when I was shopping, and they also jacked the price up at the dealership as a BS 'market adjustment''.  But to be fair, availability affected gas cars as well.  And I think some models have a much smaller difference between the hybrid/EV + gas versions - like the Toyota Highlander, which is also a $40K+ vehicle.\n\nAll in all, I am glad we are headed in a more hybrid/EV friendly future.  I really want to enter that market with my next car purchase, and I hope prices will be more palatable at that time.\n\nReal question: what appliance is the energy/electrical usage equivalent to a full charge of an EV?  An AC?  Stackables?  Fridge?  A few LED lightbulbs?  Genuinely curious, I don't know the answer. \n\nThanks for reading & responding!",

Republicans try to pretend that the discussions about the degree to which humans have impacted climate change are discussions about whether our impact is catastrophic. That’s not it.

Just because the source comes from a location you don't like doesn't mean it's wrong or faulty, you've got to actually look at the source and debunk the source. For reference, these are the sources I linked regarding the vaccine hesitancy (I didn't actually link anything for Fauci):\n\n1. Newsweek which ranks left-center in terms of bias [https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsweek/](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsweek/)\n2. A page on the GOP website with quotes from democratic politicians. Admittedly the site is republican, but they link to a number of articles and direct quotes from democrats.\n3. A video from Bloomberg which ranks left-center in terms of bias [https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/)\n4. A video from CNN which I probably don't have to tell you is very left-biased [https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left/cnn-bias/](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left/cnn-bias/)\n\n>And no, Fauci did not lie.\n\nYes, in fact, he did. [https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/fauci-lies-about-lying-about-the-efficacy-of-masks/ar-AALhCrp](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/fauci-lies-about-lying-about-the-efficacy-of-masks/ar-AALhCrp) and [https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trump-let-the-experts-lie-about-masks-and-30-million-jobs-died](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trump-let-the-experts-lie-about-masks-and-30-million-jobs-died). Scientists knew at the beginning that masks would be helpful, but Fauci admitted to deliberately misleading the US citizens about masks because he was worried about there not being enough PPE for hospitals and doctors. Now whether or not his concerns were valid does not change the fact that he told citizens, \"you do not need a mask.\" Personally, I think his fears were grounded, but lying to the American people about masks is not how to avoid that.\n\n>Your entire post is nothing but bad faith arguments. They are likely rhetoric that your parents used to make sure you stayed in their party and didn’t become a filthy librul.\n\nYeah no. Again here's the definition of bad faith: \"A bad faith argument is one thrown out to obscure a hidden agenda, coming to the negotiation table with no intent of reaching an outcome.\" I have not been trying to obscure a hidden agenda and I have the intention of reaching an outcome. The desired outcome is that you listen to what I have to say, read my sources, and supply your own opinions and sources.\n\nThe last sentence in this quote is a great example of an ad hominem logical fallacy. It will probably surprise you to know that everything I've said comes from my own study of facts and reality, not from what my parents have said. My parents have had very little to say about any of this and actually don't talk about anything that I've mentioned.\n\nNow, you've provided no sources, refused to look at mine, and committed many logical fallacies. If you'd like to continue the discussion I strongly suggest you look at what I've provided and argue the points that I brought up.

We're at a point now where we are just stepping out from major shadows in that human time period. We're still so close to it, people alive today still carry that weight in their experienced memories. Yet, we're being told to stop talking about it, stop teaching about it, and stop learning from it. No one is advocating to tell someone their importance is based on color. Teachers and historians are advocating to be clear in our history, so we can learn from it, and ensure it never happens again. Some reparations wouldn't hurt either.

Or let the continued rot run it's course?\n\nI want to also recommend reading ([or watching](https://www.reddit.com/r/chomsky/comments/uw5yfv/timothy_snyder_on_memory_laws/)) on the actions from WW2 Nazi Germany, and their successful tactics with [silencing their own history](https://www.architectmagazine.com/design/culture/the-invasion-of-memory-hitlers-attempt-to-rewrite-the-history-of-world-war-i_o) (memory laws) to distance the populous from their own past. It played a part in German public's re-acceptance of WW2 actions, tying [extreme nationality](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/29/magazine/memory-laws.html) to shield human atrocities.\n\nThe war on science has been clear. Always has been.",

Basically, those who support renewable energy talk about conservatives as if we are knuckle-dragging apes who oppose everything good and embrace everything bad. These are half-truths, at best, but they do serve to engender an \"us vs them\" mentality that does not go unnoticed by those targeted by this rhetoric.\n\nWhat happens after this kind of article?  Those who are ascribed these traits see what the Progressives want, and they oppose it.  Why?  Bandwagoning, I suppose.  If Progressives want something, and they oppose everything we believe in, then the thing the want must not be something Conservatives should want.\n\nNotice how people don't make friends of someone by declaring them the enemy and openly discussing everything one doesn't like about them?  Yeah, that's what this article is.\n\nI'm an Independent, and I have a LOT in common with Progressives, but I hate the culture war that is happening where half of the country talks about the other half as if they are moronic scum.  Intelligent people should do better than insult and deride half of the country with whatever they can drudge up, even if the claims are exaggerated and misapplied.\n\nAn example: none of the Conservatives I've spoken to about the subject of Critical Race Theory cares what College Professors can say about race, gender and sexual orientation.  What they don't want is grade school teachers spending time and energy telling grade school children why everything that is wrong in the world is because white people made the world a bad place to live in.  They don't want white first graders coming home believing that they are somehow responsible for black people living on the streets.  They don't want 2nd grade children being taught how to suck dick, or that anal sex is fun.  Those kinds of lessons are for later in life.  And before you say, \"CRT is only taught in college,\" or \"we're not teaching very young children how to have sex, or that homosexuality is great,\" we have direct evidence that these things are being taught to first grade kids.  \n\nWe should never be ashamed of our sexual choices, but leave this to the older kids.  And while white people have done horrible things, no race is free from sin. Every race has culpability when it comes to making the world a less than perfect place to live.  Piling all the blame on white people for every bad thing is not the solution.",

They are however the best course of action when using feedstock that would otherwise be wasted or burned (e.g. sugarcane bagasse).\n\n>They are the most wasteful and are net losses in money and energy as they are propped up by government subsidies.\n\nThis is just straight up not true. Wind has a lower levelized cost of electricity than coal and gas even without subsidies. Solar is still lagging behind but quickly catching up. Wind and solar generate about 5 times as much power over their life than required to manufacture and install these systems, while fossil fuels range between 1.1 and 2. \n\n>Nuclear, hydroelectric, and geothermal are the best options for the cleanest and most efficient energy. Hydro and geo unfortunately are only location specific but where it isn't we can use nuclear instead.\n\nYes, aside from the fact that hydro drastically changes the local watershed and hydrology, affecting wildlife and biodiversity. Geothermal is also great but can also cause earthquakes and subsidence if improperly managed. That being said, both should absolutely be taken full advantage of. \n\n> For the amount of waste produced by nuclear, a solar or wind farm will put way more garbage in the ground.\n\nYes, but the kind of waste matters. A wind turbine blade can be ground up and repurposed as construction materials, it doesn't have to be put in a landfill. There are already companies doing this in Germany and a few startups elsewhere. Nuclear waste is much smaller in volume but cannot be repurposed. Solar does produce more toxic components which is why wind is generally preferred. Better recycling may alleviate this problem in the future. \n\n>You can supply about 90% of power demand via a stable source like nuclear but the remaining needs to be on demand like natural gas or a gravity battery.\n\n90% might be overly optimistic but the point is very true. The best way to address this issue is with a smarter grid. There are many kinds of energy storage that don't rely on fossil fuels, although natural gas is cheap and very effective for immediate, reliable power.  \n\nTLDR; Even with all the problems, burning fossil fuels is still less sustainable than burying shit in the ground.",

The LNT model lies at a foundation of a postulate that all exposure to ionizing radiation is harmful, regardless of how low the dose is, and that the effect is cumulative over lifetime.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/environment/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

By shooting a neutron at it at exceedingly high speeds, you generate fission whereby the atom of uranium becomes unstable and split into 2 smaller atoms and neutrons and thereby releasing large amounts of energy. It would then by chance cause a chain reaction generating energy. This energy that is generated usually heats up water, evaporates it, then it cools down to drive a generator. I'm not going to go into the specifics since I'm not an engineer nor scientist. That water becomes radioactive which is bad for living creatures in general. But with proper handling and treatment, the effect is diminished or isolated enough that it won't affect humans. Compared to that, burning fuel has many more implications and issues, but that is a different topic and another can of worms.",

                "body": "The Union of Concerned Scientists supports updating safety standards at current plants and using them until we can transition to renewables. From what I understand, they don't support building new nuclear plants because of the waste issue.\n\nRight now, we don't have a secure location to store all our nuclear waste (speaking of the U.S. specifically here--not sure about other countries). The waste is stored onsite, like it was in Fukushima. The problem is that there are not many (any) states that wanna volunteer to be major nuclear waste repositories. Until we have just such a place, nuclear remains a risky choice for energy. Even if we have secure storage, human error or weather or geologic events could still cause a disaster. It's also really expensive.\n\nI have a lot of anger about this issue because I feel like people go around spreading the gospel of nuclear power while ignoring the major downsides--this is really common nowadays, esp. on Reddit, esp. among young people. I sort of get it, because climate change is one of the greatest concerns of the day, and it's true that human societies have enormous energy demands; we need a carbon neutral solution, and nuclear fits that particular bill. \n\nHowever, renewables can also fit that bill--and especially if they are developed & improved. A really infuriating problem is that there's a lot of misinformation being spread around that renewables are as bad (even worse!) than nuclear energy in terms of waste and potentially harmful environmental impacts. There was even a study released by a group called Environmental Progress (which was actually a nuclear advocacy group) which claimed that solar energy produces 300x more waste than nuclear energy, which required a real skewing of the data. For one thing, they were comparing waste by volume, not by mass; ignoring the different kinds of toxicity; omitting that solar panels can currently last 25 years; and disregarding that upwards of 95% of materials used in solar production is recyclable. The online site Skeptic looked into this report and the claims that it made, which were being spread around and amplified, particularly in conservative media, and found that nuclear produces much more waste than solar. They debunked EP's claims. \n\nBut there are still people out here arguing such self-evidently wrong points and acting as though renewables pose similar risks to nuclear (no, they don't--in case it needs to be reiterated!). There's even a comment like that in this thread. \n\nIt boggles my mind, and it makes me so angry, because I'm very worried about the potential for diaster from a nuclear accident. I think people are being dishonest. I always try to speak out about this issue, about the issue of storage, which needs to be solved if we're going to keep using nuclear power. And I hope we only use it for the short term and eventually wean off of it. \n\nI bet we can get everything we need from the renewables if we can improve them. But that will take concerted effort and investment. Why can't we have a \"Manhattan Project\" to develop renewables? (Answer: you can't weaponize them.)\n\nI'm so tired of having this discussion though, I just get people jumping down my throat and claiming I'm ignorant. And I'm not an expert, but I know that a malfunctioning windmill has never caused the evacuation of a metropolis.\n\nI'm posting a link below to the Skeptic discussion of nuclear vs. solar waste & the misleading EP report:\n\nhttps://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/38844/do-solar-panels-create-300-times-more-toxic-waste-per-unit-of-energy-than-nuclea\n\nedited for sloppy ass typos, sorry",

Solar, wind, energy efficiency, and geothermal are inherently safer. Nuclear is inherently unsafe because it’s persistently toxic fuel must be mined, transported, refined, stored, used, and then transported, processed and/or stored again. And that’s some very long term storage. There are inherent risks of accidents or worse during each of those processes. Because of these risks, nuclear needs a trusted regulator we can depend on. But in the United States, there are concerns about regulatory capture and other issues at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). It doesn’t take a combined earthquake and tsunami like at Fukushima to create real nuclear disaster concerns, as any observer of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine now knows. \n\nIn the US, we import 90 percent of our nuclear fuel, so nuclear is no quick path to energy independence. Nuclear is also so capital intensive compared to its risks that Wall-street has usually been unwilling to fund new plants without asking the general public to bear the cost of their risks. That is usually bad public policy because you want the entity operating and profiting from the plants to bear their risks—to structure the right incentives, to have the incentive to prioritize safety at all times. Thorium based uranium, smaller distributed plants, and newer technologies may reduce some of these concerns. They are worth consideration. But they are not yet ready for prime time. \n\nGiven all of those issues, it is just plain irresponsible claim, without serious analysis, that major nuclear investment is the slam dunk best course. People making these claims often also imply that unnamed “environmentalists” are ignorant green weenies who are responsible for our lack of nuclear investment, and that anyone doesn’t see the need for new nuclear is wearing blinders. I cannot count the number of times I read people adopting this tones like this online. The question of how to meet a nations energy need is just a big a question with many details. Conventional wisdom rules of thumb (e.g. grave and falsely-knowing preoccupation with “base load”) provide little useful guidance. Decisions on energy supply depend heavily of local conditions. It’s really all about long tedious analysis of how much energy needs vs various supplies, and then choosing the course of action that best serves the general public based on current information. This task is made daunting with so many special interests throwing their weight and messages around. \n\nIn case people don’t know, most of the US’s most effective and mainstream environmental groups do not oppose all nuclear. Many support continued operation and maintenance of our existing fleet. Many support some degree of research into new technologies. But they are also reasonably wary of huge new investments into nuclear given the above issues, and open questions, and especially when it competes for  investments or airtime with inherently safe and already available energy efficiency, solar, wind, and geothermal. These have many advantages such as lower capital intensity, being distributed, redundant, and local. Credible accounts say these can go a long, long way to meeting our energy needs. But maximizing them is huge political lift. We must be extremely careful that our rhetoric on nukes doesn’t inhibit maximization of those inherently safer sources. We must take them as far as they can go and the campaigns for doing so need as many vocal supporters as they can get.",

For reference, California uses about 260 TWh of electricity annually. \n\n[The power plant's used uranium can be found just a little north, here]\n(https://maps.app.goo.gl/J4t2UUjo5oAfZWni6). 35 years of fuel, 2.3x the energy California uses every year, fits in an area roughly 100ft x 200 ft. If we wanted to power the state for 100 years with the most pants-on-head method (storage with no reprocessing), it would only use 0.04 sqmi (roughly the area of 4 city blocks). With reprocessing, the amount of material to be stored (and thus the space requirements) would be much smaller.\n\n[For reference, there is a gas plant near where I live that is roughly 100 ft x 200 ft and rated for about 150 MW (about 1.3 TWh annually if running at 100%)] \n(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Von_Raesfeld_Power_Plant).

            {
                "body": "Ok, great. So the two concerns you've raised are 1) materials required, and 2) land area.\n\nStarting with the first and a quick comparison. Nuclear fission power plants require large amounts of energy intensive steel and concrete. Those two materials make up 95% of their build. There's an excellent breakdown of materials for each main reactor type here ([https://fhr.nuc.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/05-001-A\\_Material\\_input.pdf](https://fhr.nuc.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/05-001-A_Material_input.pdf))\n\nTo summarize though newer Gen 3 reactors like ABWR use 191,293 cubic meters of concrete, and 63,439 cubic meters of metal. \\[ note: volume 627,554 m3, 80kms land area\\]\n\nFor a 1.5GW ESBWR reactor which is a Gen3+ we are looking at a sizeable reduction, 104,231 m3 of concrete (250,154 tonnes) and 50,099 m3 of metals (395,782 tonnes). Volume is 485477 m3 and land area must include the 32km exclusion zone.\n\nThat's best case. An EPR reactor is double that.\n\nA 1.2GW AHTR-IT reactor gets down to as little as 50k m3 concrete and 20k m3 in metals.\n\nThe energy cost of a cubic meter of steel is 46,000 kWh, and for concrete 700-770 kWh.\n\nSo let's look at the material breakdown for a roughly equivalent silicon wafer PV solar plant in the 1- 1.5 GW range. Major materials in order are glass, steel and concrete. Followed by aluminum, steel, copper, and plastics.\n\nFor 1.5GW we need :\n\n* 105,000 tons of glass (2.4 MWh/ton in 1990, drops to 1.3MWh/ton - 0.72MWh/ton in newer all electric furnaces as we ween off natural gas fired furnaces)\n* 84,000 tons of steel\n* 70,500 tons of concrete\n* 28,500 tons of aluminum\n* 10,500 tons of silicon\n\n(I won't cover trace materials under 10k tons)\n\nThere are a massive range of nuclear reactors types and solar panel chemistries which proper studies need to factor but for this comparison I'm using best-case advanced nuclear vs common case solar PV.\n\nJust looking at the 250,154 tonnes of concrete and 395,782 tonnes of steel of a Gen3 reactor generating 1.5GW we have enough raw materials for 2.1 solar plants of the same output.\n\nThe energy inputs for glass (the main material in PV solar) per tonne is also 1/19th that for steel.\n\nSo fewer materials required and less energy overall for those materials. But then a nuclear plant produces more energy which is why the overall return on energy investment is about 20% worse for a PV solar plant (at least today).\n\nThat trade off is usually acceptable because the PV plant is cheaper, much faster to deploy, doesn't require fuel which is subject to price volatility, easier to operate, has a better safety profile, doesn't require water cooling, etc etc.\n\nWith wind energy, materials used are again significantly lower but the higher capacity factor means ROEI is about three times that of nuclear.\n\nWe need to expand our energy generation in the future and overall we're better off with renewables. There will be exceptions in some regions but nuclear is unlikely to form the bulk of new capacity.\n\nThere has been at least 180 peer-reviewed papers on moving to 100% renewable energy with most concluding it is feasible ([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544219304967?via%3Dihub](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544219304967?via%3Dihub)).\n\nSo moving to land area. A nuclear plant requires a rather big complex, and then 30-80 kilometers of exclusion/safety zone around it. Also requires access to cool water which is why they are typically located on coasts or large rivers. Places where people usually like to live.\n\nOffshore wind uses zero land area and solar is put in arid areas where people don't live and crops don't grow, or on existing structures: roofs mainly but also over canals or over shade loving crops. Even onshore wind's land area use is just 0.26 m2/MWhr, nearly half that of natural gas plants at 0.49 m2/MWhr.\n\nSolar's land area per MW is much higher \\~9 m2/MWh but solar comes with two very big advantages, it likes to be where humans can't live and we can put it \\_on\\_ things.\n\nIf all roofs in the US (8 billion m2) had solar it would provide 40% of all electricity needs with zero meters of additional land area. ([https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/02/a-solar-panel-on-every-roof-in-the-us-here-are-the-numbers/](https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/02/a-solar-panel-on-every-roof-in-the-us-here-are-the-numbers/))\n\nWaterways are another good place to put them. If California covered their 4,000 miles of canals save over 60 billion gallons of water from evaporating and provide \\~13GW of electricity. That's the same as you'd get from \\~3-10 nuclear power plants but, again, zero land area is required for it.\n\n\\- [https://newatlas.com/environment/project-nexus-california-canals-photovoltaic-panels/](https://newatlas.com/environment/project-nexus-california-canals-photovoltaic-panels/)\n\nBetween covering structures and offshore wind most of the US' electricity requirements could be met with zero increase in land area. Extra land use by onshore wind is minimal and beats gas/coal.\n\nBeyond that North America has 247,990 km2 of arid dessert. Areas where nothing grows and not much can live. Just 60,000 square kilometers of that could provide 100% of all the US' energy needs but in reality we'd only need a fraction of that as we'd use a mix of wind and residential solar.\n\nNuclear really cannot compete on the basis of materials or even land area. And certainly not on cost, speed, or simplicity.",

A barren landscape is actually ful of specially adapted organisms that cannot live elsewhere. Things like desert tortoises and many species of cactus are found no where else then America's deserts. Go ahead and put them on developed areas including canals, but undeveloped areas are for wildlife.\n\nSecondly, 100% renewable plans rely on hydroelectric, which has all sorts of issues- high land use, displacement of people, damaging waterways, putting species at risk, and causing pollution buildup behind the dams are all problems. Not to mention, dams in tropical areas can actually be quite high in their carbon output. We're seeing these issues big time in the Pacific Northwest, as salmon populations dwindle because they can no longer reach their spawning ground due to dams.\n\nThird, small modular reactors do not require water to cool, and can be dispatched rather quickly. They are also much cheaper. They are in development, but two is already in action- floating reactors. So far, so good. Sodium cooled reactors also reduce water usage to only needing steam to turn turbines, which then can be condensed and reused. \n\nFourth... Where are you getting 30-80 square kilometers for nuclear? They can and are being built on 2.5 square kilometer pieces of land. It's pretty agreed upon that nuclear is the highest output for least amount of land. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743967115300921\n\nAs for materials, firstly, you're analysis doesn't line up with other LCAs, like the UNECE's. They found that mislead years less materials and puts out less CO2 per unit of energy then solar- https://unece.org/sed/documents/2021/10/reports/life-cycle-assessment-electricity-generation-options\n\nSecond part of materials- you need batteries for pv solar and wind. Be it chemical, pumps or something else, but for those to be continuous, you need them. You also need to take into account that they are not anyways going to be producing 100% of their capacity at all times as they rely on weather conditions. You end up actual capacities of about 25% for solar, 35% for wind and 90% for nuclear of their nameplates. So a 1.5 GW nuclear plant will probably produce 1.35, and a 1.5 GW solar and wind plant will produce 0.4 and .55 GW respectively. So you end up needing to triple your nameplate capacity to match nuclear. https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/what-generation-capacity\n\nI'm not against renewables where they make sense, but nuclear also has a place in decarbonization, especially SMRs and gen IV reactor types.",

But, as I said, you get 40% from rooftop solar which cuts that down to 14% of NA desert. Cut more off that from covering other structures. Add in offshore wind and you can cut that down again to \\~5-7%. Add in on-shore wind and we might not even need any.\n\nHowever, anyway you slice it putting shade over 0-14% of the desert is not going to wipe life there.\n\nMoving on. 100% renewables [does not require hydro](https://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/21-USStates-PDFs/21-USStatesPaper.pdf). I don't know where you got that from. Hydro is by and large already fully utilized in places where it can be harnessed, there's no significant new capacity coming online, and it's not a sizable part of the green energy transition.\n\nSMRs don't exist yet. There are prototypes but nothing commercial. And there is no way enough of those could be deployed to dent climate change in a realistic time frame anyway. They also are not as efficient as larger plants. For these reasons I didn't include them. As for cooling they need either water, helium gas, liquid metal, or molten salt.\n\nThe 30-80kms refers to the mandatory \"Emergency Planning Zone\" (10 miles) surrounding a nuclear fission plant and the \"Ingestion Exposure Pathway\" (50 miles). Exact distances depend on country and plant type but that's about the ballpark.\n\nYes solar and wind require some energy storage systems (the more distributed the less required though). And yes we need 3x solar and 2x wind to match the capacity of nuclear. That's understood. So why, then, are those technologies rapidly outpacing new nuclear deployments?\n\nIt's because they require less than half the materials, even less energy, [cost a tenth of the price](https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-levelized-cost-of-storage-and-levelized-cost-of-hydrogen/), can be deployed in one-seventh the time, are far easier to operate, don't require fuel, are difficult to attack or sabotage, have no evacuation risk, have low environmental impact, operational costs don't increase as it ages, and they can be completely recycled at the end of their operational life.\n\nPeople do understand the pros and cons of these technologies and that's why new nuclear capacity just isn't a thing.\n\nFrom Jan-Oct 2021 in the US over 9GW of grid scale solar was added, 8GW of wind, 4GW of residential solar. That accounted for 86% of all new energy added. Now imagine the cost and time it would take to add 20GW of nuclear. Could that easily be done in a year? It couldn't, if you were unsure of the answer. Single reactors take 7 years on average and usually overrun on both costs and schedule.\n\nTo match that with SMRs we would need 66 built each year along with associated logistics chains for fuel, cooling, and waste. Keep in mind there are zero operating commercial SMRs right now. So you're looking at a lengthy ramp up.\n\nIf talking larger, more conventional plants, it would require 5 nuclear plants to match it. But since we have a seven year wait we actually need to be building about 35 right now in parallel for any hope of matching it in 2030. And of course all those logistics issues still apply. \n\nThere's just no way nuclear fission can catch up and that is based on current and readily available technology. Technology which is improving in leaps and bounds. Solar panels and storage in particular are seeing incredible advances year on year.",

Humidity would also increase due to the shade and barrier. https://www.climatecentral.org/news/solar-study-sees-ecological-risks-19568\n\nI got that because at the moment, hydro is the most reliable and largest producer of renewable energy. he paper you linked. LITERALLY uses hydro, it's part of the \"Water\" section of Wind, Water, Solar. \n\nSMRs do exist and don't need cooling because they are small. There are two deployed right now. https://www.world-nuclear.org/press/press-statements/first-small-modular-reactors-open-a-new-world-of-a.aspx \n\nAnd yes, nuclear power plants need cooled, but that's a problem why? That's how steam is produced for the turbines.\n\nYour land use includes the emergency worst case scenario meltdown plan. That land isn't just empty, it's built on and used for other things. Newer reactors also are safer and see less loss of radioactivity materials when they meltdown. Look at Fukushima, most radiation experts agree that the evacuation was overkill and ended up killing more people than letting them stay would have. https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/evacuating-a-nuclear-disaster-areas-is-usually-a-waste-of-time-and-money-says-study-87697\n\nWind and solar are easy to put up that's why. But to actually match the output of a nuclear power plant, that's hard. It's also because nuclear has been regulated to DEATH because it was a scary Boogeyman for a while. Now we are realizing things like the Non-Linear Threshold model might be wrong, and that not all reactors are scary RMBKs that can meltdown like Chernobyl. Hopefully regulatory agencies catch up to that.\n\nLazard report doesn't look at materials, just cost. And yes, pure solar and wind are cheaper, but storage is not, and that's needed with solar and wind. \n\nThen start nuclear plants now. Best time to plant a try is 30 years ago. Next best time is now. Also, 20% of our electricity comes from nukes still. So we're still heavily relying on them, more so than wind and solar at the moment. Next clean energy source is wind at 8%. So those nuke plants we already have are invaluable to our decarbonization.\n\nI don't get why you are so anti-nuclear that you insist on not having them. They are slow to build, but we can start now and have a massive amount of clean energy in 7 years while also putting up wind and solar where it makes the most ecological sense- not in the middle of a desert or grassland.",

Especially when doing so replaces the entire fossil fuel industry and helps to curb climate breakdown. \n\nThankfully the study you linked backs me up here. They identified 5.4% of California's entire land to be suitable for PV solar, and another 1.5% for CSP. \"we identified 22,028 and 77,761 km2 of Compatible and Potentially Compatible area, respectively, in California for developing PV\". Enough for at least 14TWh of electricity.\n\nHere's another great tidbits from the study; \"After accounting for unprotected environmental attributes like biodiversity, Cameron et al. (14) identified ∼7,400 km2 of relatively low-value conservation land within the Mojave Desert Ecoregion (United States) that can meet California’s 33% renewable portfolio standard for electricity sales seven times over\".\n\nSo clearly, as I've been saying, there is plenty of space available. And very little negative impact to habitat. I'm not saying there isn't an impact, there always is when you build something and solar plants are [no different](https://www.vox.com/2021/8/18/22556193/solar-energy-biodiversity-birds-pollinator-land). But the benefits obviously outweigh the downsides and that's reflected in the research. \n\nMoving on. You complain about nuclear regulations as if we didn't have 300,000 evacuated because of Chernobyl, 100,000+ evacuated at Fukushima, and 144,000 people leaving the area around Three Mile Island. I agree accidents are rare but when they happen it's a *massive* problem. I'd rather just avoid those problems altogether instead of trying to get better at playing with fire.\n\nI will also point out that even before all those pesky regulations to try and limit disasters it still took them 5 years to build Chernobyl. Only slightly less than the seven years it takes us now and absolutely nobody is willing to compromise on safety standards.\n\nI'm not anti-nuclear at all. Nuclear would have been great to deploy - last century. And last century I was calling for that. We should have started phasing out coal for nuclear in the 70s or 80s. But we no longer live in the last century. Nuclear is now old tech. It's time has passed and it has been beaten by better options. That's all. There's no point having a side. \n\nI've outlined the problems with nuclear not to argue against out of some ideological reasons but simply to explain to you *why nobody is deploying nuclear  -*and why they won't*.*\n\nThe US and China added 1,000TWh of wind in 2020. One year. Enough to replace \\~40% of all nuclear plants in operation.\n\nNuclear accounts for 10.5% of global electricity generation but it took 70 years to do it.\n\nRenewables already account for more than double that, 28%. (31.6% in the OECD) And they managed that in under 20 years with very early technology.\n\nProjections suggest this year we will add 44 GW of solar and 27 GW of wind (and over 8 GW of storage), and a total of 200 GW will be added in the next four years.\n\nThere's absolutely no way nuclear can compete with this rate of progress. It simply has no advantages over renewables and that gap is only widening each year as PV panel and energy storage systems continue to explode.",

There's also things like plastics in medical devices that, while plastic, allowed us to innovate life saving devices generations before it would have been practical/possible using other materials. See biocompatible plastics in pacemakers, for example. \n\nThe logistics between innovation and the dissemination of a practical solution almost always involves massive corporations. I'm not saying I approve of the modern corporate structure or their apathy toward brutal externalities---I spend my career fighting those systems. \n\nI'm simply saying that \"corporate chemicals\" may be too broad of a term to make into a boogeyman, especially given \"corporate chemistry\" has been involved in many of humanities great triumphs, like the moon landing, significantly reducing cholera/polio/TB/syphilis/etc outbreaks across the world, preventing many structural catastrophes caused by fire or rust, or curing leukemia in an individual child.

Yesterday, the company unveiled a series of incremental improvements that it says will allow it to capture twice as much CO2 for half the cost and half the energy consumption of its existing tech. Climeworks plans to build its first “generation 3” facility in Louisiana, part of a project that was awarded a $50 million grant from the US Department of Energy in March.\n\nWhile Climeworks’ first two plants together are capable of pulling about 40,000 tons of CO2 from the air annually — about 1% of the emissions of a typical coal-fired power plant — the new tech will put the company within reach of hitting several million tons per year by 2030 and a billion tons by 2050, co-founder and co-CEO Jan Wurzbacher told reporters.\n\nIt’s no surprise that Wurzbacher is bullish on carbon removal. But the company’s own cost forecasts, plus all of the other available evidence about how quickly the nascent industry can mature, suggest that without much more direct government intervention to force high-emitting companies to pay up for carbon removal credits, there will likely be a major shortfall in the availability of carbon removal by midcentury. Carbon removal tech breakthroughs don’t fundamentally make them a more feasible hedge against slow emissions reductions.\n\n**[Read the full story here.](https://www.semafor.com/article/06/05/2024/carbon-removal-still-wont-save-the-planet?utm_campaign=semaforreddit)**",

Capitalism doesn't inherently have much of anything as it was a word made up to describe people's problems with the status quo.

You're using the language of a critic of the status quo (as it was in the mid 1800s) to describe the economic alignment of modern nations. Marx wasn't an economist, he was a philosopher. His ideas were pretty interesting and provided a unique perspective. Aristotle was also pretty interesting and provided a unique perspective.

It doesn't change the facts about how it works or how it is especially destructive to our environment.\n\nWhat is destructive to the environment is *production.* Any economic system involves production, but in order to produce anything, natural resources must be harvested from the environment. That harvesting is harmful. Ipso facto.\n\nThe solution to environmental problems is to produce less. The problem is that when we produce less stuff, more people starve. Maybe not literally starving from hunger, but some resource or comfort is unavailable and desired for more people. \n\nSo we can either use less resources by being more efficient (which has happened a great deal over time) OR by having a cultural change that does away with some of the \"unnecessary luxuries\" we have grown accustomed to like air conditioning and showers OR by having less people around that need to consume resources. \n\nThe \"mode of production\" is irrelevant unless there is one far more efficient than another.

I don't care what you call the mode of production that Marx calls capitalism. Whatever you call it, it is the system we have and it has specific dynamics, incentives and consequences.\n\nAs for boiling this down to a general problem of aggregate production, you are trying to flatten away an obvious problem with (what I am calling) capitalism. Production under capitalism that exists to produce profit is going to look completely different to production that exists to produce utility. It matters WHAT is produced. A billion dollars of GDP from fossil fuels has a completely different impact on emissions compared to a billion dollars of GFP from solar power or healthcare or social care. \n\nYour food example is also easily debunked. We could dramatically reduce the money spent on food by switching from animal products which are expensive to produce and environmental destructive to more plant-based foods which are both much cheaper to produce and sustainable. GDP falls while MORE people can be fed.\n\nIgnoring WHAT is produced is boneheaded. And the political economy decides what is produced.\n\nYou think you have zeroed out the effects of different political economic systems on emissions. You haven't at all.",

That kills the local economy, and local job markets become saturated with applications.

The United States is producing so much oil that it has undermined the influence of OPEC, which failed when it tried to make production cuts recently to drive prices up globally. The amount cut was quickly backfilled by the United States and other non-OPEC nations, which gladly grabbed the market share OPEC forfeited.

They were all the kinds of t-shirts that he would wear. I think I visited 5 different thrift stores to find them all.\nThe backing and border was from old sheets.\nHe loved it.\n\nYears ago I made new clothing items out of combined discarded clothing items, and sold them on Ebay.\n\nI came across an online clothing line a few years back that exclusively made their \"signature\" items from old t-shirts, jeans, and other odds and ends.\n\nThe items we're so well made that it was clear they had some really talented sewists doing the work. These items sold at a high-end price point, too.\n\nThe problem is that people have gotten accustomed to wearing their clothing so few times. \nThey buy a dress for a single event; or their clothing no longer fits after 6 months - because of body-changes; or items that once the wearer puts them through the washer/dryer they have shrunk, twisted their shape, or lost their texture.\nThe last thing happens because manufacturers don't pre-wash/pre-shrink their fabrics before cutting. \nThis has always been a big complaint of mine. \nWhen sewists create something the first thing they do is run the yardage through the washer and dryer so when the item is completed and goes through the wash  - it stays exactly the same wash after wash.\n\nUntil all - or at least some of these issues are addressed I don't think the overwhelming amount of dumped clothing everywhere in the world is ever going to go away - or even be reduced. \n\nThoughts?",

There is a lot of symmetry in nature, in fashion, emulating nature, colour and symmetry is preeminent. \n\nHowever in upcycling, that is far more difficult. Mismatched scraps or textures or patterns that don’t flow together, stains or uneven wear or dirt, that’s often not at all like in the natural world that we try emulate. \n\nThings like keeping items whole and cleaning them and maintaining symmetry and design by matching components as one would with high class or high quality new fashion, thats possible but time consuming, laborious and expensive, so is usually delegated. Also, people like to copy another. Making clones is how you profit. \n\nA single item, set or pair of shirt or pants or hat or shoes is expensive in human labour. \n\n(Note it’s called ‘labor’ and not ‘fun’ or ‘enjoyment’ or ‘love’ or ‘satisfaction’)\n\nYou can’t profit from it.\n\nHowever, if you make many identical items, you can profit, and others can too.\n\nThe outcome is upcycling creates individual bespoke or unique items and then if you love it you won’t want to sell it, while in parallel, if someone sees it and wants it, who loves it, it’s totally unavailable to them and so is like showing off while in parallel, preventing them from ever being like you or looking like you. Many people do NOT want to be unique but DO want to be like others. \n\nSee….\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZbM6tDcoNgg?si=g5Oi0Ls_sXJOsCQ5\n\nWith lyrics, slightly more comprehensible!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UNNtVy2aJcU?si=Ory8Vpktbq_UxiUf\n\nHere’s an example of successful IT industry up cycling. \n\n* All computers or phones or tablets go to a warehouse. \n\n* They are collated till there is enough for economy of scale and assembly line processing to make handling affordable\n\n* They are cleaned \n\n* They are stress tested\n\n* Known bad components are exchanged- eg. Electrolytic Capacitors degrade rapidly when not occasionally charged (not used) and also when used heavily (always on) - batteries or cells used to power time clocks or other components that store fundamental settings, fans that are damaged or unbalanced, disks or random access memory modules or solid state storage that is known to fail or be susceptible to high levels of failure under normal or heavy use. \n\n* At that point, the hardware can be more comprehensively cleaned, knowing it’s worth it. \n\n* Corrosion protection is applied to the critical components to ensure future failure from adverse environmental conditions is less likely\n\n* at this point, the item can be sold individually or as is (parts missing) or upgraded using new or secondhand parts\n\n* the item can be improved by utilising new or upgraded or downgraded firmware, if the upgraded firmware is slower or impairs performance or function by having additional security features that are unnecessary \n\n* the item can have often, the most up to date and recent software installed, so it’s ‘as new’ and is modern from the perspective of ‘being close to or identically as functional as a completely new computer with new software’ if still not as fast, or secure, or reliable (security and reliability usually go hand in hand for any computers that are online and used typically on the modern internet, unless very sophisticated routers and firewalls interfere to automate the blocking of high risk websites or scripts or code or block known security exploits designed to take advantage of old hardware or software or firmware, creating uncertainty and interference or promoting theft or manipulation of the computer or the person’s data)\n\nPhew! \n\nThen it can be handled as anything one would sell as a ‘complete good-to-go unit’.\n\nAnd most importantly, it would be one of many, so if it broke or didn’t work it could be tested against another that is identical. \n\nThat last thing is very important.\n\nIf you have something that is unique, it’s very difficult to work out the root or foundational or primary cause of a failure. You have nothing to compare it to!\n\nIf your up cycled shirt breaks, how do you get warranty on it if it’s because it was badly up cycled?\n\nWhen computers are maintained, serviced, repaired and refurbished and upgraded, and you have done that to more than one, then you have another that is able to be checked ‘in comparison’ to what was sold.\n\nThis creates trust and good will - the manufacturing or refurbishing agent can provide warranty or guarantee of some limited sort, even if not to replace something but to say ‘yes, sorry, we made a mistake’ or ‘yes, that was a faulty process’ or ‘that product had faulty components or inclusions that we didn’t detect would be a future issue in the range of circumstances people use them in, even though we tested them comprehensively with every effort to try to sell the highest quality items refurbished or upcycled that is attainable, given the complexity and difficulty of working with old items instead of new materials or new items made to different quality standards or higher tolerances with better or more consistent or stronger or more durable materials’ \n\nWhen up cycling fashion, none of that really exists at scale. \n\nYou have to start with \n\n* Collating in a protected, safe environment \n\n* Using high care and attention to detail\n\n* Using information management to help speed handling of vast amounts of items or materials\n\nEdit: interference, a word was changed by someone other than me after I typed it.

Take a tech company like YouTube as an example. Sure all the videos and ads are virtual, but YouTube cannot run without servers handling the billions of user requests. These servers require minerals to be manufactured, coal used for the metallurgy of the metal, oil for their transportation, and fossil fuels again to generate the electricity to run them.\n\nEverything in the modern world requires at some point physical resources. Digital industries are not the exception, and in some ways, are actually more resource-intensive in minerals. So the growth of digital goods is tied to the growth of physical commodities.\n\nThis why the entire of idea of decoupling cannot work at a global level. It is true that rich countries in OECD decreased GHG emissions while growing GDP. But that is simply because globalization delocalized the bulk of heavy industries to China and global south countries. The global total of emissions still increases, it is just not directly attributed to global north countries. It is just an accounting trick.

An excerpt: “The minimum of 27cm is the sea-level rise deficit that we have accrued to date and it’s going to get paid out, no matter what we do going forward,” said Dr William Colgan, also at Geus. “Whether it’s coming in 100 years or 150 years, it’s coming. And the sea-level rise we are committed to is growing at present, because of the climate trajectory we’re on.”\n\n> and they know that climate change is nonsense.\n\nAnd for this assumption. \n\nIf they have access to all he best information they know something slightly different:\n\n- Noticed the \"100 years or 150 years\"? So 27cm (a bit less than 1ft, at minimum but let's run with that, it probably won't be *much* more\\*) within at least 100 years. ***That*** is the reason why billionaires don't move, **it doesn't affect them (and their kids) personally.** They are gone in 100 years, their kids may be gone, too, and they are not interested in the far future. \n\n- 27cm in 100 years would be 2.7cm (a bit more than 1 inch) in 10 years or a bit more than 1/10 inch in one year - who's gonna notice that with their own eyes?\n\n- It's not their *immediate* problem, a sea level rise of 27cm (a bit less than 1ft) in 100-150 years does not affect their annual income...\n\n- ... *unless they'd decide to do something about it*, then it would cost them. So they have a good monetary reasons to *not* do something about it it.\n\n- Then again, convincing as many people as possible of climate change being \"nonsense\" cost them just a little and those people just continue living like they do, literally not worrying about tomorrow. They continue to be good, happy customers :-)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\\*: That article also mentions 52m (about 150ft) of sea level rise within a millenium. Now that would be a reason to move higher up on the beach but you have 1000(!) years to do it. (5.2m in 100 years, 52cm in 10 years, 5.2cm (about 2 inch) in one year, that's still just a little and it's not happening now, it will happen later on, if nothing is done about it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit: Removed some typos, improved formatting.

Each vehicle requires 1000s of battery cells to be created into a pack which is the bottleneck for EV manufacturing at scale.

They were too expensive but now the entry level options are respectable and dependable. EVs will always be more expensive than their gas engine counterpart. Maybe that Camry is more efficient than the F150 lightning trimotor or whatever but that F150 is way more efficient than any pickup truck.

He might have been the best guy to be elected, but due to whatever external factors wasn't terribly effective at getting his vision across.  I give him a ton of credit as a person and for what he wanted to do, and my sympathy for the myriad ways he was screwed over.\n\nReagan was an extremely effective President (or, at least, his puppeteers were) but not a force for the greater good.  We are still feeling the effects of his policies very deeply over 40 years after he was elected.\n\nBush Sr was not especially effective, malignant, nor benign.  He just kind of occupied the office for 4 years.\n\nClinton I liked a lot when I was in high school and immediately after.  Under his administration I had a good job with excellent medical benefits.  Today, in hindsight, some of his neoliberal policies strike me as more harmful than helpful.\n\nGWB, we all know about him.  Ditto Trump.  I don't think either was as damaging in the long run as Reagan, nor as effective.  Obama I like better than Clinton but have some of the same neoliberal wariness.  He tried to cooperate with the Republicans too much and failed to achieve all the things he could have.\n\nBiden... I can't say I exactly like him, but I don't hate him, either.  He reminds me of Bush Sr in a lot of ways.  A statesman, a lifelong politician, a status quo guy.\n\nBottom line is that Dems need a President as effective as Reagan and as progressive as FDR.

Factoring in the rising global demand for meat, many have questioned whether our current resource-intensive means of production can be sustained for future generations. However, current global food production can feed the rapidly growing world population, says new research, but only if most people replace meat and dairy with vegan foods.  \nResearchers from Lancaster University’s Environment Centre and Small World Consulting, a UK-based sustainability consulting firm with a focus on climate change, analyzed both the global and regional food supply in a study published in the journal “Anthropocene.” The researchers aimed to gain an understanding of how many crops are used for human consumption versus how many are fed to animals.  \nThe study concluded that “current production of crops is sufficient to provide enough food for the projected global population of 9.7 billion in 2050,” but in order to do so, radical changes to our everyday food choices must be made.  \nglobal food production  \nThe research suggested that swapping “most” meat and dairy with vegan products is the first step, followed by social acceptance of eating crops such as maize, which is typically relegated as feed for livestock.  \nResearchers posit that if the global population does not adopt a more plant-centric diet in the near future, an increase of 119 percent in edible crops grown would be required by 2050. But, currently, the global livestock system occupies 45 percent of the earth’s arable land, leaving little room for new crops.  \nThe new research is backed by previous studies. The largest analysis of global food production, which was published last month in the journal “Science,” revealed that a vegan diet is the most effective way to combat climate change. Further, it stated that if everyone eliminated beef from their diets, global land use would drop by 75 percent — freeing up arable land for crop production.  \nAdditionally, a recent report by Our World in Data suggested that a plant-based diet has the potential to solve world hunger. Further, another study published by the National Academy of Sciences stated that swapping meat for vegan food could feed an additional 350 million people.\" Live Kindly  \nhttps://www.livekindly.co/historic-newcastle-pub-carriage-become-vegan-eatery/",

It's got a light and flaky texture, with a vegetal flavor like spinach and a bit of sweetness. They also make seaweed snacks out of it; they're one of my favorite things, and I would eat them in bulk if they didn't cost so much.\n* Kombu (an edible kelp) is the stuff in miso soup. It's got a texture a lot like nori, but more substantial; it's like the pita chip to nori's cracker. Its flavor is especially savory.\n* Dulse is the seaweed that some people say tastes like bacon. I wouldn't've called it like bacon, but I do agree that it's more on the savory side than the sweet side, and saltier, with a sort of minerality / smokiness to to it. It's one of my new favorite baked-potato toppings; I crunch it up and sprinkle them on like bacon bits. The texture is like kombu.",

We can't rely on trees solely to pump all the extra CO2.  \n\n\n60% of CO2 extraction comes from the ocean (plankton). It's actually much more than trees, swamps, agriculture, meadows, etc.  \n\n\nHowever the amount of carbon we extract everyday (coal, gaz, oil) that's within the earth (and not in the cycle of photosynthesis yet) is well beyond anykind of natural capacity to remove it. And even if we could plan massive forest, trees die, decay, and reject CO2 and methane so the only way to \"capture\" said carbon is to put it back into the earth. Basically what happens in the ocean when plankton dies at the bottom and calcifies.   \n\n\nThere is no way we can plant tree to solve earth. It's not happening. Only stopping extracting carbon and burning it can change. Rest is not scalable.",

In fact we are chopping down or burning trees far faster than we’re planting them (especially in places like Brazil and Indonesia).\n\nBut let’s look at technological alternatives. The largest operational, man-made carbon capture plant in the world (the “Orca” plant in Iceland) can remove approximately 4,000 tons of CO2 from the atmosphere each year. That is around 0.00001% of our _annual_ carbon emissions (~34 billion tons), and equivalent to the capture ability of around 200 acres of trees. That plant only exists because of the unique geology of Iceland, and equivalents can’t just be built anywhere. In comparison, there are numerous 200 acre areas worldwide that could be planted with trees.",

There is a great article on how [Natural Gas](https://context.capp.ca/articles/2020/pirl-fertilizers/) is largely used to make Ammonium and Nitrogen type fertilizers. \n\nThe cost of [natural gas](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/natural-gas) going up in a parabolic curve is really putting pressure on farmers especially in countries outside of North America and they are ether skipping or using less fertilizer which will cause smaller yields of crops. You are already seeing for shortages in places like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and even some parts of Africa. This is a huge problem especially in more emerging countries.\n\nThe next one is transportation costs. We currently do not have a viable transportation method that doesn’t involve semi trucks who are heavily being impacted by the higher diesel costs, due to a [distillates shortage](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/weekly/images/disstusm.gif) and a combination of not enough refineries online as many shut down during covid. I would also add that those who work on farms will also talk about diesel costs hitting into their Cap-Expenditure costs especially when it comes to harvesting.\n\nOverall we as the consumer can only do so much but we shouldn’t forget about how the energy crisis impacts other parts of the world.

This video does a great introductory highlight of that, imo.\n\nI'm not so sure about their first video in the series, tbh, but this one is worth a watch. We treat farmers like hell in this country, and it's really important to start talking about that because, beyond humans rights and welfare, if we actually work with and help farmers, we'll be able to work towards a more equitable and sustainable food system.

But WHY is ‘infinite growth’ a necessary component of national economies?  \n\nI argue that it is the “interest” that banks charge for their ability to simply create money from thin air when they issue loans to customers.    \n\nYou have to pay back the principle AND the interest.  But only the principle is created.  You have to find money to pay the “interest” from elsewhere.\n\nSince private banks create and allocate upwards of 97% of the circulating money supply….\n\n…97% of the money supply is loan principle, and must be repaid.   Which means it is “retired”, meaning that is meets the other side of the balance sheet (the “debt” you owe to the bank), and it cancelled.  It is removed from circulation.\n\nIn the other 3% of the money supply, there is NOT enough money to pay all the interest on the loans which comprise the 97%.\n\nErgo, banks need to issue *more* loans, some of which pays the interest on past loans… \n\nBut this is the crux.  There is *always* more “interest debt” than actual money in circulation.   \n\nSo *Growth!* -must- happen, or else banks’ loans do not get paid back.  And then banks become “insolvent” on their balance sheets.   They stop loaning money, and then the economy falls into “Recession”.\n\nIt’s a form of Ponzi scheme.  Literally.\n\nWe are beholden to bank profit, which fundamentally requires economic ‘growth’ so that banks remain ‘profitable’, or else they hold the economy hostage with a ‘recession’ and punish everyone by stagnating “credit creation” and seizing up the money supply.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED Talk… *lol!*",

And there are specific reasons why that is true.\n\nNOTE:  I’m 100% in favor of Degrowth, and not arguing for the current system..

It's a hobby horse of mine.\n\nIt's good to know about the prisoner's dilemma and other [collective action problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem). Environmental problems are indeed collective action problems, and game theory and other formal modeling approaches can be helpful in analysis and problem solving. At the same time, I think it's important to be aware of the ways that formal models in public discourse can be used for the purposes of what Phil Agre calls \"technical rationalization\" ([source](https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/notes/00-8-8.html)):\n\n> A second challenge to public reason is technical rationalization,\nby which I mean the application of math-based analytical frameworks\nto practical problems.  Examples include the mathematical models\nof operations research, a tremendous variety of simulation methods,\nand too many others to enumerate.  These models reached their peak of cultural legitimacy during the Cold War, but they date back centuries\nand persist robustly today.  Rationalization produces reason-effects\nin the sense just described, but its use of mathematics and its\napparatus of deductive logic also give it a special claim to reason.\nDeductive logic is airtight in a precise sense: given the premises,\nthe conclusions follow.  Proponents of technical rationalization often\nfeel very strongly, and it is easy to see where they get their fervor.\nThe matters that they model are often controversial, and answers that\ncan be publicly defended through airtight deductive logic are greatly\nto be preferred to the hidden agendas of politicians and entrepreneurs.\nTo question rationalization, on this view, is to question rationality,\nwith all of the dire consequences that I mentioned before.\n\nFor people who care about technical rationalization in public debate, check out Kristin Shrader-Frechette's work, such as her book *Risk and Rationality*, or Mayo and Hollander's *Acceptable Evidence: Science and Values in Risk Management*. If you really want to get into it, Mayo's later work in the philosophy of statistics is also relevant here.",

First, the obvious one of COVID. The idea of imposing lockdowns was initially accepted very widely, despite absolutely no recent precedent. Of course it turned into a political football etc but if there had been a consistent message coming from right and left and cultural leaders, then compliance with measures to handle COVID could have been fairly widely accepted for a long time. Notice what happened in Australia where the right wing government bucked the trend and backed fairly harsh measures. Many people where disgruntled but the level of acceptance remained high for a long time.\n\nSecond, I would cite the widespread and sophisticated infrastructure of manufacturing consent by the media. This is an awesome (if awful) machine that has effectively suppressed dissent against an oligarchic system of hoarded wealth and elite control of the population. It is a highly sophisticated system of thought control in democratic societies with proven results.\n\nMy point isn't that we should recruit these controls. It's that public opinion is in fact malleable.\n\nMy preferred tools would be education and a widespread series of citizens assemblies that take decisions out of the hands of elites, and put them in the hands of ordinary citizens who have been extensively briefed on the science and the possible solutions.

It won't be a smooth transition, but neither will the world eliminating meat and so the two can go hand-in-hand. It's quite telling that you only see farm animals as food and don't think they can be kept as pets & given love in a safe environment without harvesting their bodies afterwards. \n\nAnd the drain on what??? Not all people who eat almonds are vegan. And vegans are pretty cognizant of that stuff (hence why there are a disproportionate number of them on environmental subreddits). Many, myself included, know about the harmful affects of almond/chocolate/palm oil etc and seek to avoid them/replace with the much environmentally lighter soy/oat milk. In any event, it's way less environmentally damaging than cow milk will ever be. So if you want to talk about \"draining riverways and aquafers \" once again, as with basically every other environmental issue related to farming, you have to take it up with those who eat meat and support animal agriculture. \n\n>My final thought is this.

In grids away from the equator, under conditions of high electrification rates of autos, gas powered home appliances, etc - winter peak heating demands creates VRE intermittences that require clean firm power, yes. You note that nuclear could service that peak demand, but there’s many methods which could efficiently do so given the time to continue scaling - such as advanced geothermal, exotic battery chemistries, or cavern-to-turbine hydrogen facilities. We may not have those methods at full scale right now, but we also aren’t going to see full scale electrification over night - the two move in tandem. \n\nWe should go vegan, try to drive less, fly less, install solar panels on our roofs, etc. But decarbonization does not **require** massive disruptive lifestyle changes in the main. There are political movements that could leverage decarbonization into a broader project that wants to change patterns of power in the economy (eg a dense-urbanist led path to decarbonizing transport by shrinking VMTs and challenging the suburban homeowner-led model of wealth-building) - but those are political choices to turn decarbonization into a broader project.",

The resulting vehicles were high powered, zero emission, but could only run for approximately 100 miles on a charge, which is sufficient for most day to day driving. Because they knew that the technology was feasible and because of the global warming phenomenon resulting from the uncontrolled burning of fossil fuels, California state regulators passed the Zero Emission Vehicle Mandate in 1990, requiring all auto makers to offer for sale in the state zero emission vehicles. The electric car was the most promising technology at the time. It was argued that they were more environmentally friendly than conventional vehicles, even if the electricity was produced through burning coal. Under pressure from all the auto makers who sued the California Air Resources Board, the mandate was revoked in 2003. Despite lessees who loved their electric vehicles, all the auto makers repossessed their electric vehicles and refused to re-lease or sell the vehicles even to their existing users. Many forces seemed to be working against making electric vehicles available, despite technology itself making their production and operation feasible.\"\n—Huggo\n\nSo yes, you can blame the companies for not making the proper products available to consumers, for multi-million dollar marketing campaigns convincing people they need things like dairy to be healthy, and for poor manufacturing and packing practices, simply because it is more profitable for them to have it that way.",

Those familiar with the topic immediately realize that the video is filled with lies and doesn't include a shred of convincing evidence for its bold claims.\n\nEven Frank Mitloehner, the \"expert\" featured in the misleading video, has been frequently criticised for being heavily influenced by the livestock industry (e.g.: [https://clf.jhsph.edu/sites/default/files/2019-04/frank-mitloehner-white-paper-letter.pdf](https://clf.jhsph.edu/sites/default/files/2019-04/frank-mitloehner-white-paper-letter.pdf)).\n\nThe subject of the video makes it particularly problematic. The most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet even found, for example, that avoiding meat and dairy products is the ['single biggest way'](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth) to reduce your environmental impact on the planet. But while it is scientific consensus that reducing the consumption of animal products is crucial for climate and environmental protection, people are always ready to listen to somebody telling them they don't have to change. WIL's video has already been watched by around 1 mio. people, thus causing enormous damage and misinformation.\n\nMany Youtubers have already responded to WIL's anti-scientific video. My favorite response comes from Earthling Ed: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkMOQ9X76UU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkMOQ9X76UU) \\- Please watch & spread the video if you can!\n\nWhether environment-related or not, misinformation on YouTube (and elsewhere) ultimately harms society at large and needs to be called out and broadly rejected.",

Half of this reduction (1.5 billion ha) actually won't happen because [it has no livestock and corresponds to very marginal rangelands and shrubby ecosystems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211912416300013). The vast majority of the other half is grassland, with most of it permanent grassland not suitable for crop production.\n\n**Emissions**: the authors claim that excluding animal products would reduce 6.6 billion tons of CO2eq. Let's consider an American living in the Western world. Such person would consume on average [124 kg of meat/yr](https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production) (based on production so it's a bit exaggerated). With a global meat production of 341 million tons, we get an individual reduction of 2.4 tons of CO2eq/yr. Let's compare that with other activities.\n\n- Driving: [A typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 tCO2eq](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle). Keep in mind that this only counts the CO2 produced by burning fuels and does not include the footprint of the car itself (which can be [around 9.2 tCO2eq](https://www.greenpeace.de/sites/www.greenpeace.de/files/publications/gp_cleanairnow_carindustryreport_full_v5_0919_72ppi_0.pdf)), of car maintenance, of fuel production and of infrastructure construction.\n\n- Flying: Using a simple [footprint calculator](https://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=3), a round-trip flight from say, New York to London, would cost 1.6 tCO2eq.\n\n- Household energy use: [A household of 1 uses 55.3 MBtu](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2015/c&e/pdf/ce2.1.pdf). [1 kWh emits about 0.99 lbs of CO2](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=74&t=11) which means 1 MBtu = 0.132 tCO2eq. A household of 1 then emits 7.3 tCO2eq, a household of 2: 9.98 tCO2eq (5 tCO2eq/member), and a household of 6: 13.7 tCO2eq (2.3 tCO2eq/member). Household of 1 and 2 members takes up about 60% of the total household in the US. Also, living in apartment buildings can reduce emission by 2.7 times compared to living in a house. \n\nMoreover, looking at emissions alone is incredibly misleading. Different from fossil fuel burning (in which emissions have no corresponding carbon sinks of similar time scale), livestock emissions (cows, specifically) is still a part of a dynamic carbon cycle. CO2 gets absorbed by plants, part of it goes into the plant body and a bigger part goes to their roots and is stored in the soil (soil carbon sequestration). Livestock then eat the plants, releasing CO2 through respiration and CH4 through enteric fermentation. Those are then absorbed/pulled down by soil, the ocean, other living organisms, etc, and the excess goes to the atmosphere. People have tried to capture this process but we could not account for all moving gears in this complex machine. Just look at these bottom-up estimates and compare them to GHG concentration and you will notice a huge discrepancies, specifically in the carbon sinks. I have yet to see these estimates verified with GHG concentration measured in the atmosphere which is what actually matters. According to the global CH4 budget, 97% of emitted CH4 are removed by carbon sinks](http://www.globalcarbonatlas.org/en/CH4-emissions). This paints an entirely different picture when we consider the net emissions which actually contributes to global warming (instead of total emissions). \n\nFrom another perspective, the increase in CH4 in the past few decades is [much lower](https://www.sealevel.info/co2_and_ch4.html) than that of, say, the 1950s to 1980s. Which makes absolutely no sense since we are producing [significantly more meat](https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production) than we ever did in the past. [Radiative forcing from GHG concentration](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016GL071930) says pretty much the same thing. While CH4 is a big concern (25%), most of it was released half a century ago. Now, the main problem is CO2, i.e., fossil fuel.",

We can eat the food we grow for our cattle to eat and we would have too much good to consume. Even without it we waste a lot of it  already. Sit and watch Earthling Ed. Then find me credible, unbiased researches which counters his arguments, without any sleazy way. Use several sources. Search for Researches which support WIL video and are unbiased, I'll wait.

The increasing popularity of vegetable oils such as corn, sunflower, and safflower has lead to a rise in n-6 fatty acid intakes in US and Western diets (Simopoulos, 2002), whilst intakes of n-3 have declined (Bailey,2009). __In the metabolic pathway n-3 and n-6 fatty acids compete for the enzyme that is able to convert them__ (Davis and Kris-Etherton, 2003). __Diets with a high ratio of LA:ALA can suppress DHA synthesis in favor of docosapentenoic acid(22:5n-6; DPA) which takes the place of DHA in the retinal and neural tissues__ (Sanders, 2009). Delta-6 desaturase is the enzyme responsible for synthesizing LCPUFA’s from ALA and LA. The activity of this enzyme can be reduced by aging, stress,diabetes, eczema, and some types of infection. Various dietary and lifestyle factors can impair LCPUFA synthesis including high intakes of saturated, hydrogenated or “trans”-fatty acids, a lack of vitamin and mineral cofactors and lifestyle choices such as smoking and the use of alcohol and caffeine (Bailey, 2009). Therefore, usually, __very little ALA is converted to EPA and even less, if any to DHA__ (Sanderson et al., 2002).

At least not yet.  \n\nEVERYONE, not just vegans, should be advocating for a shift in what is heavily subsidized by their Government. How much money are taxpayers wasting on corn fields instead of fields of lush, nutrient dense vegetables? \n\nIf you use veganism as a way to connect with people - that's great, awesome. What it does not do is illicit the actual changes we need in order to reduce our global footprint. It is not a great global solution as it stands right now, and requires that shift in subsidization mentioned earlier. \n\n\nIt is not your place to criticize anyone's journey. Those of us who are concerned will always be in different stages based on a platitude of factors. I'm glad you can afford it where you are at, with your socioeconomic status, and have the resources to be aware of the issues that plague our society. \n\nAttempting to tie civil rights to the vegan belief that animals feel pain, and therefore should not be consumed is absurd. BIPOC, Natives, and other minorities are not bred in cages for slaughter and consumption. The struggle those communities face are apples are oranges compared to the ethical conflict of consuming meat.  If you are so concerned about both, perhaps you should be asking yourself: \"What am I doing to make veganism more available to everyone who might not be able to afford it as is now?\"\n\nMy priorities are different. I believe that we need to address the energy grid first and foremost, address the lack of potable water, and ensure value is provided to everyone. Once those societal issues have started to be addressed, then we can start looking at transforming agriculture, and heavily advocating for a more plant based diet. \n\nWe can try to do this all at once, but big bills rarely pass unless the government is going to shut down, and even then the bills tend to get slashed; diminishing the effects and slowing down the real change we need. \n\nFinally, I should apologize. I should have considered my words more carefully. Coming together as a community, and reducing emissions is a wonderful fantasy. There are waves being made, but once again they are not on the level that is needed for a more sustainable society. Even with 7 - 9 billion vegans, we could not prevent global climate change without addressing other higher emission sectors.",

                "body": "Edited to fix formatting:\n\nYes, I agree that other sectors need addressing as well. But veganism also frees up a lot of energy and land resources. The vast tracts of land that could be freed because they are not growing feed for livestock could be rewilded and serve as an additional carbon sink. I still don't see why advocating for veganism has to be independent of reforming the energy grid, the two tie in in some ways and in others can simply coexist as reform strategies. \n\nI fully understand that not everyone can go vegan, but this is often misrepresented as a much larger facet of the population than it is. Veganism can make diets cheaper in many cases, because foods like potatoes, lentils, rice and other simple staples are some of the cheapest and most accessible foods. But the best way to get people able to go vegan is to go vegan. By supporting alternatives to animal products and plant farming, we can reduce demand for animal products and increase demand and the resources for innovation in vegan foods, driving up variety and driving down costs. This is in part what led to foods like beyond meat and impossible foods, which have in turn made bug strides in increasing the accessibility of veganism. \n\nCivil rights, apart from the base factor of citizenship, can absolutely apply to veganism. Now this is not to equate the different issues therein, of course slavery and segregation are greater evils simply because humans have a higher capacity for suffering in more emotional and mental areas. But animal agriculture is similar on that it is a widely accepted practice which is not widely spoken out against and requires advocacy to increase the rights of an oppressed group. That's why I like it to civil rights, because in many ways it is a modern movement with similarities in structure and methodology to civil rights. Once again, the two are not equal, and there are of course civil rights issues ongoing today which require attention, but even an evil which could be considered small becomes a massive issue when extended to the billions of animals slaughtered annually. \n\nSimply put, I don't see why we can't do all of these at once. All of the issues you bring up, reforming the energy grid, increasing access to potable water and ensuring equal rights can be pushed in tandem with veganism and can be reinforced by it. Access to water, for example, could be made for better if water was not wasted in the production of animal products. Additionally, if I have a privileged socioeconomic status which is the barrier for entry to care about societal problems, how do you expect to get anything done? Nothing proceeds if only a select few are permitted to care about something, because others have too little time. I'm doing my best to make the facts available and presentable for the people who don't have that time, but don't act as if it's a rarity to be able to care and that I therefore shouldn't tell anyone else about change for fear that they don't have the capacity. \n\nThis wording is kinda a mess in fairness but I simply don't see the point in ignoring something that, if you'll forgive my assumption, someone like you could do easily. I'm not even asking you to go out and do activism, just make a personal switch. But you're not only helping the climate, you're helping the animals and fighting some of the most major polluters, as well as making veganism more accessible to everyone else.",

We are unlikely to destroy nature by leaving it alone. That should be fairly obvious. Avoiding animal agriculture is not an intervention. It is the *avoidance* of damaging intervention in nature on a huge scale.\n\nWhen it comes to reducing animal agriculture, again, you seem to be missing something very obvious. If we stop farming, say, beef, then we would only need a tiny amount of that land to replace all the calories, protein and other nutrients using plant-based agriculture - no more than about 15%-20%. The other 85% would be unused. And there would be no point doing farming on the other 85% because there would be no market for the food. We would already have fed everyone! \n\nRegardless of what we do with emissions, we already have more CO2 in the atmosphere than is sustainable. And given that there is no sign of emissions starting to fall rapidly, as they must if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change, that means we have to start actively pulling down (sequestering) carbon from that atmosphere to counteract past and future emissions. We have to do both - cut emissions and sequester carbon. And reforestation and rewilding are about the cheapest ways to sequester carbon that we have.\n\nWhen deciding what we should be aiming to give up to save the climate and the natural world, there are obvious better and worse options. Giving up modern communication technology would deprive billions of people of knowledge, the ability to communicate with friends and family and would return society to a lower standard of living. \n\nOn the other hand, giving up animal agriculture improves your health, it's cheaper, it avoids the main cause of pandemic risk (which is habitat destruction due to animal agriculture) and it's more ethical. It has no actual downsides. It just requires people to change what they cook.\n\nSo rather than this disingenuous anti-tech nonsense, why not do something that it's obvious will be better for your health, better for billions of innocent abused animals, and is actually necessary for the habitability of the planet. Reduce or end your consumption of animal products. You can do it today. There is literally nothing standing in your way, except your own excuses.",

It's a lower priority than animal agriculture as it's less destructive and much harder to substitute for.\n\nAgain, asbestos is a terrible analogy.

We have set up a transition that is already underway that our global economy, supply chains and systems of governance will not survive, and the idea that tinkering with personal consumer choices will somehow fix this while ignoring the juggernaut that brought us here is infantile. These endless pushes for individual actions while the neoclassical extraction economy rampages along somehow unnoticed are ridiculous. \n\nOur systemic way of life is the problem. We dredged millions of years worth of sun energy that was buried and added to the atmosphere. At the same time we tore the surface of the planet to pieces. We are not making any meaningful systemic changes to slow or fix this and the transition is becoming self driving as feedbacks are triggered. \n\nRemember folks, these debates over which individual action needs to be taken so we can rest easy are exactly what the business elite and governments love to see so they don't have to make tough decisions to address this.",

        "text": "10 Reasons To Go Vegan\n\n*“To get mud off your hands, use soap and water. To get blood off your hands, go vegan.” -John Sakars*\n\nVegans are like adults. At first, you hate them, then you become one and realize they were right all along. Veganism is a way to drastically reduce suffering for humans and animals, as well as your impact on the environment, and your risk of developing serious ailments. “*There is no fundamental difference between man and animals in their ability to feel pleasure and pain, happiness, and misery.” -Charles Darwin.* Veganism is one of the most effective ways to help combat animal cruelty. Refusing to pay for animal products lowers demand, reducing the number of animals being bred to suffer and die on farms and in slaughterhouses. Here are ten of the many reasons to go vegan. \n\n10. Health\n\n*“People eat meat and think they will become as strong as an ox, forgetting that the ox eats grass.” -Pino Caruso*\n\nGoing vegan lowers the risk of chronic diseases and illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, multiple cancers, dementia, osteoporosis, diabetes, and high blood pressure, to name a few. Veganism is the only known diet that can fully cure “irreversible” conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease. Vegans who follow a wholefoods plant-based diet also tend to live longer, 9.5 years longer for women and 6.1 for men.\n\n9. Water Use\n\n*“We are, quite literally, gambling with the future of our planet- for the sake of hamburgers.” -Peter Singer*\n\nA pound of beef needs 1,799 gallons of water, 576 gallons for a single pound of pork, 518 gallons for a single pound of chicken, 628 litres for one litre of milk, and 53 gallons for a single egg. That's a significant amount of water. It's no surprise that we have so many droughts! Not to mention the fact that 790 million people do not have access to clean water if they have any at all.\n\n8. Resource use\n\n*“Basically we should stop doing those things that are destructive to the environment, other creatures, and ourselves and figure out new ways of existing.”-Moby*         \n\nEven though the world's cattle eat enough food to meet the nutritional needs of 8.7 billion people, one of every nine people – 795 million – suffers from chronic malnutrition. People from Africa, for example, import grain rather than use it for food, and receive only small amounts of money or meat in exchange. Global hunger would be eradicated if we stopped breeding 80 billion animals into life.\n\n7. Land Use\n\n*“By eating meat we share the responsibility of climate change, the destruction of our forests, and the poisoning of our air and water. The simple act of becoming a vegetarian will make a difference in the health of our planet.” -Thích Nhất Hạnh*  \n\nAnimals or the food they consume occupy 40 percent of the land on the planet. They need space for this, which explains the widespread deforestation. Although soy is the primary cause of forest degradation, more than 70% of it is fed to livestock in factory farms. The use of vast amounts of land by grazing cattle is the second most important factor. Animal agriculture is responsible for 91 percent of deforestation.\n\n6. Ocean\n\n*“Nothing will benefit human health and increase chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet.” -Albert Einstei*n\n\nDue to overfishing, the oceans are expected to be depleted by 2048. Our oceans are being increasingly polluted with plastic, with fishing nets being the primary source. Dead zones and acidification are caused by bacteria from pig urine dumped into the ocean. The annual death toll of marine animals is so high that it is only estimated in tonnes. (1,600,000 tonnes)\n\n5. Climate Change\n\n*“Not eating animal products for breakfast and lunch saves 1.3 metric tons of carbon emissions per year.”-Jonathan Safran Foer*\n\nWe are all aware that CO2 is bad for the environment, but it pales in comparison to methane, which is 84 times worse. What, therefore, are the primary sources of methane emissions? Agriculture of animals. Our greed to consume farm animals is directly responsible for 71% of methane emissions. Animal agriculture is the leading source of GHG, accounting for 31% of total GHG emissions. This does not include the amount produced from transportation.\n\n4. Human Rights\n\n*“As long as man continues to be the ruthless destroyer of lower living beings he will never know health or peace. For as long as men massacre animals, they will kill each other. Indeed, he who sows the seed of murder and pain cannot reap joy and love. -Pythagoras*\n\nThe shocking unmeasurable emotional toll of working in a slaughterhouse and the mental health issues that come with it. The poor conditions. Minimum wage. Lack of jobs. Child labour. Crime rates. All of these issues are specifically related to animal agriculture and are cause for concern. Due to a lack of jobs as immigrants, people are hired to kill such gentle and loving creatures and are forced to suppress their emotions. Domestic violence, social isolation, anxiety, substance and alcohol abuse, and PTSD are all possible outcomes of this emotional dissonance. Another study shows that towns with slaughterhouses have higher crime rates. According to another study, cities with slaughterhouses have higher crime rates. These individuals are forced to suffer while only receiving minimum wage. When it comes to child labour, most leather is produced in China or India, where children are regularly exposed to cancer-causing chemicals as they are required to soak leather in large tanks. Children have also been known to collect silk by boiling cocoons with caterpillars inside, often resulting in serious burns.\n\n3. The Egg Industry\n\n*“Animals are sick and in crowded, prison-like conditions to make dairy and eggs. It doesn’t take a lot to draw the line from how we treat animals to how we treat humans.” -Natalie Portman*\n\nMany people believe that eggs are harmless and therefore may consider being vegetarian. Let's begin at the beginning. Chicks are born in a hatchery and thrown onto a conveyor belt. Workers will separate the males from the females, each being thrown onto a separate conveyer belt. The girls are dropped in crates, but the boys are subjected to a far more egregious fate. The male chicks, as well as any weak or deformed birds, are thrown into a macerator, an industrial mincer, where they are destroyed. The SPCA has deemed this method of disposal \"humane.\" The girls are transported to a factory farm, where they will spend the rest of their lives in either battery cages, which are about the size of an A4 sheet of paper and hold four to twelve chickens, or small enclosed sheds to be labeled \"free-run.\" With free-run chickens, though they aren't in these battery cages, they don't have access to the outdoors. What about free-range eggs? These chickens live in the same conditions as free-run chickens, with one minor exception. People feel better about themselves after purchasing them. All that is required for a \"free-range\" label is a space large enough to allow 5,000 chickens out of 50,000 to have access to the outdoors. After all this suffering at just eighteen months old, they are trucked to the slaughterhouse and killed.\n\n2. The Dairy Industry\n\n*“We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow and steal her baby, even though her cries of anguish are unmistakable. Then we take her milk that's intended for her calf. And we put it in our coffee and our cereal. “ -Joaquin Phoenix*\n\nThe dairy industry, like the egg industry, is inherently cruel. Like humans, cows are strongly maternal beings who need to be pregnant to produce milk. To produce sperm, a bull must have an electro-ejaculator, which is essentially a cow dildo, shoved up his anus. That semen is injected into the cow while a fist is shoved in her anus to hold her cervix in place. After carrying her calf for nine long months she will give birth. Within the first twenty-four hours, her baby will be torn away from her. She’ll pine and cry out for days or even weeks, sometimes in the next barn, able to hear them cry but unable to reach them. If her calf is a boy, he will be considered waste and will either be killed on the spot, sent to slaughter at five days old, or forced to live in veal crates for twenty-one weeks. If she is a girl, she will be subjected to the same mental torment as her mother. This process will be repeated five to seven times before her milk production begins to decline or she collapses from exhaustion, at which point she will be trucked off and slaughtered.\n\n1. The Animals\n\n*“The problem is that humans have victimized animals to such a degree that they are not even considered victims. They are not even considered at all. They are nothing; they don’t count; they don’t matter. They are commodities like TV sets and cell phones. We have actually turned animals into inanimate objects – sandwiches and shoes.” Gary Yourofsky*\n\nThe three most commonly consumed animals are as follows: pork (36%), chicken (33%), and beef (24%). So I'm going to start with the pork industry and go over the legal and cruel practices that make the meat industry inconceivable.\n\n1. Pork\n\n*“When I see bacon, I see a pig, I see a little friend, and that’s why I can’t eat it. Simple as that.” -Paul McCartney*\n\nThe majority of pigs bred for food are born into a gestation crate, a small central cage system that allows the piglets to feed on the sow while preventing her from moving around. The pigs are kept on metal grates, which cause pressure sores on the sow's skin due to the hard surfaces. As the sow's body becomes less capable of producing the large litters encouraged by the industry, the number of stillborn and mummified piglets increases with each litter. 10% to 18% of piglets born alive will not make it to weaning age, succumbing to disease, starvation, dehydration, or being accidentally crushed by their trapped mothers. The runts of the litter, who are deemed financially unviable and killed by staff using a method known as \"thumping,\" are included in the death toll. When a runt is thumped, their back legs are lifted and their head is slammed against the hard concrete. Pigs that make it through the first few days are mutilated without anesthetics, their tails and teeth cut to prevent cannibalism, and pieces cut from their ears or tags punched in as a means of identification. As they age they are moved into grower pens. Overcrowded, bored, and frustrated, they resort to cannibalism. They will stay in these pens for six months until they are sent to slaughter. At the slaughterhouse, pigs are crowded together in a truck, going hours and sometimes days with no protection from the extreme weather and with no food or water. When they arrive the pigs are placed in small concrete pens where food and water are denied. When the pigs arrive, they are placed in small concrete pens where they are denied food and water. Using an electric prodder, pigs are herded to the kill floor. Co2 gas chambers are the most common method of stunning, and they are used by all large pig abattoirs. This is deemed as the most \"humane\" method. The system of rotating cages lowers the fully-conscious pigs two or three at a time into the heavily concentrated gas, which begins to burn their eyes, nostrils, sinuses, throat and lungs while suffocating them. Lower concentrations would be less painful but would take more time and is therefore deemed as economically unviable. \n\n1. Chicken\n\n*“The soul is the same in all living creatures, although the body of each is different.” -Hippocrates*\n\nChickens bred for food begin their lives in a hatchery. Even though the industry uses both males and females, macerators are still used for weak or deformed birds that are unlikely to make it to slaughter age. The chicks are housed in large sheds that can hold anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000 birds. The mortality rate is 4-6% within the first week, resulting in 1,600-3,600 dead chicks per shed. The vast majority of these chicks will have been found dead by workers, killed, or discarded alive. Selective breeding, lack of exercise, artificial lighting and heavy antibiotic use which enhance food absorption have resulted in broiler chickens growing at an unnatural speed and weight, reaching 3kg in just 35 days versus the natural peak of 2 kg in 96 days. Their bodies are unable to withstand the extreme pressure and collapse under their weight. These sheds are not cleaned through the entire cycle and the build-up of feces causes high levels of ammonia which burns their eyes, nose, skin, and lungs. SPCA approved simply means they have a single perch running down the middle, but other than that conditions are identical. Depopulation occurs at night when the birds calmest. They're crammed into small plastic cages and loaded onto trucks to be slaughtered. They are hung roughly by their feet onto an automated shackle line. They are lowered into a bath of electrified water to stun them before their throats are slit by an automated blade, but if they lift their heads, they can miss the stun bath, facing the blade fully conscious and ultimately drowning in scalding water further down the process.\n\n1. Beef\n\n*“Part of my becoming a vegetarian was that I would look at my burger, then look at my dogs, and I wasn’t able to see a difference.” -Kristen Bell*\n\nCalves raised for beef are subjected to several painful procedures that are performed without anesthesia, including disbudding, dehorning, ear tagging, castration, and hot iron branding. Beef sold in major supermarkets comes from cattle that have spent their lives in barren feedlots, where they are fattened up with grain or grass before being slaughtered at the age of eighteen months. They are forced into a knock box at the slaughterhouse, where they try desperately to escape. The captive bolt gun is a gun that penetrates the cow's skull to stun it, but smaller guns, in particular, are frequently ineffective against such large animals, causing only pain and limited movement rather than unconsciousness. After stunning, they are chained by their back leg and hoisted upside down, where their throats are slit and they are bled out. \n\n*“I personally chose to go vegan because I educated myself on factory farming and cruelty to animals, and I suddenly realized that what was on my plate were living things, with feelings. And I just couldn’t disconnect myself from it any longer.” -Ellen DeGeneres* \n\nWar has claimed the lives of 619 million people throughout history. Every three days, we kill the same number of animals, and this does not include the deaths of fish and other marine creatures, which are only measured in tonnes. Before we kill them, we must first breed them. Confine and exploit them for food, entertainment, clothing, and science. Their entire lives, from birth to death, are dominated by profit-driven industries. An empire built on pain and bloodshed. Paid for by consumers who are told that their treatment was ethical. Free-range, organic, and local. That their deaths were humane, that animal cruelty does not exist in our country, and that if it does, our government, our authorities, will track it down and put an end to it. And we, as consumers, have no reason to believe otherwise, because eating and using animals is normal to us; we've done it forever. The products on supermarket shelves are so far removed from the individuals who once existed, some only briefly, and others for years without relief. Individuals who share our capacity to feel love like us and the companion animals we adore. Who share with us, our capacity to suffer. Our desire to live, to be free, to be recognized for who we are as individuals rather than as objects or for our utility to others. They are beings in our own right, not production units. Not stock, Not \"it,\" but \"he,\" \"she,\" and \"they.\" The truth is that killing someone who wants to live cannot be done humanely. It's not a matter of treatment or finding better ways to do the wrong thing. Larger cages, lower stocking densities, or less painful gas. We tell ourselves that they have lived good lives, and in the end, they don’t know what’s coming and don’t feel a thing. But they do. In their final hours, minutes and seconds, there is always fear, there is always pain. The smells of blood. The screaming of other members of their species, with whom they have shared their lives. Never a willingness or desire to die, but rather, desperation to live, a frantic fight to their last breath. And never are they shown mercy or kindness, instead mocked, laughed at, kicked, beaten, tossed like ragdolls, or sent into a mincer because they were born the wrong sex. We take their children. We take their freedom. We take their lives, sending them into slaughterhouses healthy and whole, only to emerge as packaged pieces on the other side, and we tell ourselves that something humane and ethical happened along the way. We harm ourselves in the process. We devastate the environment by emitting more greenhouse gases from animal agriculture than any other industry, destroying our forests and slaughtering our native animals to make way for farms. Despite this, we continue to justify animal agriculture as normal, necessary, and natural. That the animal kingdom, or certain species within it, are inferior to us because they lack our specific type of intelligence, are weaker, and are incapable of self-defence. We believe that because of our apparent superiority, we have earned the right to exercise power, authority, and dominion over those we perceive to be inferior, to further our own short-sighted goals. It's a rationale that's been used before. To enslave the blacks or to take their land and children by the white man. To assassinate Jews by the Nazis. To silence and oppress women by men. Are we doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past? Is our species defined by this superiority complex, this pure selfishness? Or are we capable of something more?\n\nVeganism isn't as difficult as some people believe, and it doesn't make you sick or weak.

People will line up to read your novel of a post after that.\n\nI absolutely support your choice and understand your reasoning for being vegan. However, when looking at this sub I'm getting tired of people being beat over the head with how they suck as human beings for not being vegan.

Please don't post preachy and naive stuff like this, if anything it pushes people further away and you become exactly what you describe; the vegan that people dislike. Lowering carbon footprint is important, but so is being realistic about it.\n\nThe very first one, Health, is already hopefully one sided and with no nuance. There are plenty of people who cannot simply change to a vegan diet for health reasons. If you are highly active with a large muscle mass it is already so incredibly challenging and expensive that it is ridiculous to implement in everyday life, just the sheer volume of food they have to eat is crazy. There are also several health conditions where purely vegan food will make life incredibly difficult and you will have to take a load of supplements.\n\nEating vegan is also a luxury that many can't afford. While you may live on a homestead or in some big city with numerous options, many cannot physically get to or afford the food needed to live properly on vegan food. Many rural areas in the world have very limited food options.\n\nI'm sorry but I think this is the one time I'll pull the \"check your privilege\" card.",

But restricting an entire food group from my diet without overwhelming evidence doesn't seem like the right thing for me.\n\nThe point I'm mainly interested in however, is the **Environmental** one. I've always held the belief that meat consumption is a hard net-negative on the environment, but I recently watched [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGG-A80Tl5g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGG-A80Tl5g) which made me reconsider what I've always held as a given truth. He also raises a good point on food waste, which I don't hear people talk very much about. I'd love to hear what your thoughts are!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nAlthough I am happy to discuss vegetarianism from a broader point of view (it is the subject after all), I would at the same time like to avoid this turning into a shit-slinging contest.

The guest speaker may work for the beef industry which could mean that he gets paid to paint the picture in favor of meat.\nThe “evidence” he provided was that ruminants only eat food that humans can’t eat.\nThat would be true if they were raised in the wild like they were back in the good old days. Now, and what there is overwhelming evidence in support of, is that most beef, pork and poultry are raised in factory farms and are fed corn and hormones so they don’t die from the horrific conditions they are grown in.\nThe argument ignores the facts and paints the picture that these animals are just happy creatures, eating what they would normally eat, and that the industry isn’t using a cheap GMO corn and feed that makes the nutritional content of their meat even less beneficial. There is a myriad of evidence that still has to be examined scientifically that may link human disease to these practices as well but the industry pays scientists millions to keep that evidence from being on the front page. Science will tell the truth but I think we may not have time as long as there are billions to be made, before the damage done is irreversible.\nEnvironmentally, the feed corn and corn grown for more profitable industry than just having corn on the cob, are using up most if the arable land.

It's just that information gets buried and ignored, probably due to bias.\n\nI especially admire results of practitioners, not theorists, who by decades of veganism practice show the health benefits of it. Galina Shatalova and Joel Fuhrman are examples.\n\nI am a practical man with no preferences and beliefs to protect.

I use an app called Too Good To Go which helps support businesses by purchasing a mystery bag of food that would otherwise be wasted. Some of these bags are not vegan and I was wondering if this is still sustainable since it’s being saved from the landfill and if this has a bigger impact than just purchasing plant based ingredients.\n\nThank you",

        "text": " Tumblr Link: [https://diariesofthehermit.tumblr.com/post/649179762755059712/the-ecology-of-black-liberation](https://diariesofthehermit.tumblr.com/post/649179762755059712/the-ecology-of-black-liberation)\n\nText:\n\nIt is hard to be Black. It is harder still when you choose not to numb yourself to the world but to take it all in. The pain that exists within this body is already acute, yet the pain that exists within the world-body is still magnitudes greater. As tempting as it may be, however, it is best not to be numb. Pain is a warning, a signal for danger, and those who do not feel pain cannot sense the arrival of hurt and of death before it is too late. Therefore I have no choice; I must feel. And as I am not separate from the world, I must feel Her pain too; Her aches are my aches, Her hurt is my hurt and our death is one. \n\nWhat do we suppose liberation to be? Liberation from poverty, from misogyny, from homophobia or racism? What good is it to be liberated into a dead world, one that does not support life of any class, gender, sexuality or race? I suspect that for many, liberation is equivalent to equality, a levelling of the political/social/economic playing field within our society. As I get older, however, I become more and more sympathetic to the view that Malcolm X espoused in his Nation of Islam days: the “world” of western civilization is fucked, and there’s no hope for anyone integrating into it, equally or not. To be “liberated” is to liberate yourself from a doomed society and to build your own. My attraction to this mindset, however, is tempered by the growing twenty-first century truth that there is no longer any place left to build: if indeed our current global, capitalist civilization has not covered every inch of the world itself then its shadow surely does. Fate, now, is collective; the destiny of all life is forever intertwined. \n\nIf you’ll forgive the apparent digression, I need now to talk about trees. Trees are, after all, essential to Black liberation (as are all ‘things’ essential to life); to put it another way, the fates of Black people are tied directly to the fates of trees. To do violence to them is, in a very real way, to do violence to me, my family and my community. To think otherwise is to operate under the basic misconception that Nature and people are somehow independent, separate entities. \n\nI recently read an academic study titled [“Deforestation and World Population Sustainability: a Quantitative Analysis.”](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-020-63657-6.pdf&t=ZGI1MzcxZDU5MzVkNzlmMmJjMDc4MjM4ZjAyOWRiOGJmNTI5MTQ0YyxiNjQ5NGRlMDk3ZmZmNjRlMmMyN2MxZDVhZmM3Mzc4OGExNmJjODBl&ts=1619106149) It emphasized, first, the importance of trees to the earth’s life and civilizations: they prove indispensable to our existence through the production of oxygen and the cleansing of the atmosphere, maintenance of the soil, regulation of our water cycle and, a key factor given our contemporary crisis, the regulation of our planet’s climate by keeping its carbon in them instead of in our atmosphere, where it would accelerate the already lethal pace of planetary warming. “Trees and forests are our best atmosphere cleaners” the authors wrote, “and, due to the key role that they play in the terrestrial ecosystem, it is highly unlikely to imagine the survival of many species, including ours, on the Earth without them. In this sense, the debate on climate change will be almost obsolete in case of a global deforestation of the planet.” Obsolete, note, because we’d all be among the dying or dead.\n\nThe authors of the study then used multiple variables, such as the world human population, the amount of earth covered by forest, the growth rate of the human species, the rate at which we extract resources from the environment, the projected rate of technological improvement in resource extraction, the renewability of those resources and those resources carrying capacity to calculate the survivability our current society. They gave us twenty to forty years before “catastrophic collapse” spelled the end of human civilization and perhaps of the human species itself, with an “optimistic” 10% chance of human society continuing if we can begin in earnest to expand our civilization into the solar system and harvest its resources. \n\nWe all know, however, that if the wealthiest and most industrialized nations began to expand their societies into space, that Black people are going to have a hell of a hard time getting there. Of course, it’s hard to accurately predict the future. Any model of the times to come that depends on future human behavior or expected rates of technical progress is inherently fallible. We may very well survive much longer than that. There is also the alternative, however: considering that we are not only harming our forests, but the soil, the oceans, our atmosphere and indeed the entire biosphere itself, perhaps their calculations of civilization’s end times are not too far off. Perhaps they’ll come sooner. Who knows? The future itself is an unknown. Yet, what we can perhaps say with certainty is that the possibility for total extinction, or at the very least the extinction of human civilization, is now very real. We are not discussing an end of a civilization, or of a society, but of human society itself. Forever. It is an existential threat that the “wretched of the earth”, the poor and the marginalized, cannot afford to ignore. We do not, after all, deserve this fate. We did not bring the world to this point. But do Black revolutionaries have time to discuss it? Is it not best to leave such things to those who have the privilege to worry about the global environment and not whether a police officer will kill them at a traffic stop, or after barging into their home in the middle of the night based on bad intel? I would argue that, in regards to this threat and any other, white people can and will not save us. Have you seen the news on climate change? White people cannot save themselves- they cannot even agree amongst themselves if the threat exists. \n\nYet the global working classes (even those who carry the label of “white”), the marginalized and the colonized, do not have the privilege of these debates. Wealth will not insulate us from the worst. We have seen Katrina, and how its effects upon communities were proportionate to their wealth and racial make-up, and we should understand that Katrina is just the first sign of what’s to come. Already, the air we breathe, the food we consume and the water we drink have a detrimental relationship with the life-spans of the urban poor; the very earth is weaponized against us. For the moment She has only fired warning shots and her real rage is barely apparent. It is, however, on the horizon. Who will feel it worst, I wonder? \n\nThe authors of the study offer us some hope aside from Star-Trek like voyages into space. According to them, we live in an “economical” society, which tends to value the welfare of a few privileged components over that of the entire system. Extrapolating a bit, it is indeed clear that not only do we see “humanity” as somehow separable from nature, but that the wealthy and powerful in particular have conceptualized themselves as a group apart from the rest of us, well, peasants as well. What is needed, according to the study’s authors, is a transformation into a society that values the whole as much as the parts and that works for the sake of the all instead of the few. Such a society does not make false dichotomies between people and nature, or between the proletariat and the nation, or even between nations themselves. We are all integrated into a single system in which each part supports the existence of all the others, and to understand one person in their fullness is to, by necessity, see the whole. \n\nI am for, and will always be for, the existence and welfare of the Black community. I would just like to point out that without a healthy planet there are no communities, Black or white, and that Black liberation without planetary liberation is nonexistent. We live and die with our mother; we live and die, in fact, with trees. Which is a wonder, because I’m willing to bet that most of the diaspora in industrialized nations, living our lives so characterized by atomization and isolation, walk by them every day without a second thought. Your true body, though, does not end with your body. I challenge you: the next time you walk down a park, a block or a city street, notice the trees. They are you. One being, one fate.",

My partner and I live in a smallish city, and we're able to do most of our chores by sharing one vehicle. On a side note, even if all cars were electric, they would still be very space-inefficent.\n\nSo yes, the car industry pumping out new cars each year is frustrating, but it's the public's demand for cars which is giving this industry money. There's very little we can do, unless we change society's car dependance.\n\nAnd omg that is long sentence!

Electric cars are the logical choice for future personal transportation, but what about work applications where you need to tow 16,000-lb. loads or agricultural equipment so farmers can keep producing food.

The actual wording is \"the average income in America is $50,000\". Does this factor in $0 for the unemployed? Or for those voluntarily unemployed like SAH spouses? Probably not as it is likely reported income. I also don't think kids would be factored in to that, so since about 30% of the US population is 14 or less (2019) we'd likely have to subtract those. It probably does factor in the income for those on passive income and unemployed though. \n\nAlso, we run into the \"Mean v Average\" problem.  If Jake makes $340M per year, he makes as much as 6,800 \"average\" Americans. 10,000 making the world average. Or 24,941 average Nigerians. This would indeed skew the numbers. \n\nMy overall idea of the wealth of the country largely being the best indicator of the \"1% to blame\" is borne out by carbon emissions by country. In 2017 the US accounted for 13.77% which is more per person than China (29.34%),who is the biggest source, as they have about 4.25 times the population we have. Also of note is that a portion of China's carbon emissions are for goods manufactured for the US. We also are double the emissions of India who are also more than 4x the US population.

Even though our capitalist-driven “grow or die” economy has brought us welfare and prosperity in the past, it totally fails when it comes to solving the key problems we have to solve – the problems of rising inequality and global ecological breakdown in the near future. And if you didn’t know yet: Humans are running out of time... However, it is not too late yet, together we can make fundamental changes!\n\nThe last months I have worked passionately on the podcast “How degrowth can save the planet and improve your well-being!”. This podcast aims to teach you the main issues within our economic system and introduces you to the degrowth theory, which has the capability to solve these issues! The degrowth theory advocates for societies that prioritize social and ecological well-being instead of corporate profits, over-production and excess consumption. Without most people knowing it, we are shifting towards a society where your well-being and the relation with nature is vital again!\n\nWhat do you think about this theory and its potential? Do you believe that it can become the new standard for societies?\n\nYou can listen to the podcast by using the link below (Spotify + Youtube)!\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/posts/willem-van-dort-120585194_how-degrowth-can-save-the-planet-and-improve-activity-6785517570142347264-Vojp",

        "title": "The Three Laws of Ecology ?",
        "text": "The rules for saving this planet are in fact quite simple: \n\n**R1. Be few** (Work for a demographic decrease. Have few children. Occupy only a small  part of the earth. Get rid of leaders who teach otherwise.) \n                  \n**R2. Be poor** (Or live frugally as if you were poor. Demand and expect little.  Don't get used to luxury.) \n\n**R3. Be wise**   (Find ways to achieve your goals with minimum damage to the environment. Think before acting. Plan, forecast, read up, research,            experiment, act cautiously. Reduce your footprint.) \n\n\nA few numbered comments. \n\n**C1**. We have had environmentalists  around for many decades, but they basically deal with Rule 3 only. \nWhy  is that ? Because they sense that their message is tragically unpopular and Rule 1 and Rule 2 are even more so. \nTheir message can be phrased as: Don't do what is most profitable and expedient. Do what is best in the long run for the planet, the other species, the other countries, the future generations.  This is the negation of  \"Economy is paramount\" . \n\n**C2**. The first rule implies: we are too many.  One way to read it is: YOU are one too many.  But  you don't need  to be  afraid of a decimation. \nWe are talking about the next generations. Have few children and  make sure this applies to everybody. Your tradition, your family, your commandments have  always exalted a numerous progeny? Well, things have changed — the opposite is now true. \n\n**C3**. Rule 1 basically concerns a single parameter, that is, the total number of humans. But you are obsessed by something else: differential birthrates. \nSince the women of a different ethnic group deliver an average of 5 children, our own ethnic group will be swamped in a few generations. \nThis is how you feel, without the need to peruse the relevant statistics. \n\n**C4**. Rule 2 means: renounce wealth — an unwelcome prescription, if ever there was one. \nIt is generally accepted that one's efforts to be free of destitution are totally commendable. \nBut if the little capital that is needed to lead a comfortable life is multiplied by a thousand or a million, it sure becomes a stigma. If this idea (that the very rich may be poisonous to society) is new to you, find your own examples and justifications. \n\n**C5**. The three rules are sorted by decreasing importance (for example, if you comply with Rule 1, you may be less strict with the other two). \nThey are all unwelcome but, again, in decreasing order. \nThe complexity of their application, on the other hand, is in increasing order. \nThe target of the first rule is basically a single population count. \nThe second rule entails a few measures, such as how many calories you expect in your diet or how many kilowatts or how many cubic meters of \nclean water or what other resources you demand.  Sometimes this is labeled your \"footprint\". \nThe third rule implies ... countless volumes of research, science, technology, biology, ecology and what not.   \nWhatever was discussed under the heading \"environment\" goes here: greenhouse effect,  global warming, ozone shield, peak of oil, desertification, aquifers, pesticides, species extinction, pollution ... (you continue) ... \n\n**C6**. Simple common sense would dictate that Rule 1 be treated as paramount in any debate or deliberation on global governance. \nBut no, it very seldom appears on the agenda (or, for that matter, on newspapers, Internet sites, national plans, ...). \n(Reference: \"Population: The Multiplier of Everything Else\" by William N. Ryerson - Post Carbon Institute, Stanford Univ.) \n\n**C7**. To clarify Rule 2 and 3. I demand that the temperature in my house be kept between, say,  20C and 32C — this is my arbitrary target (Rule 2). \nAt the level of Rule 3, I must find the best way to achieve this. This can range from moving to a country with nearly constant temperature, to adopting \nheat pump technology,  to  installing some  other heating and cooling devices, etcetera. \n\n\n\n\n© Copyright Mauro Guazzo 2019\n\nTo comment via private mail: three.rules.2021@gmail.com",

        "title": "Seaspiracy and sitting with your own emotional turboil for a deep inner change",
        "text": "I watched a documentary on Netflix called Seaspiracy and felt deeply shaken by it. I have also read the critics and the fact that they might have used only some part of factual evidence and might have misreported some interviews, all possible but at the end of the day they are talking about something that is happening, the consequences of which are evident everywhere but not acknowledged in the public eye, as this would lead to changes, economic losses, job losses etc. I do encourage everybody watch it though, as I feel a profound sense of discomfort in today’s society. I could keep on living my life as it is in my bubble pretending that I am doing the right things but deep inside knowing this is not right, this is not enough.  Deep inside, I am responsible as I feel that we all share a degree of responsibility for how things are. I could use less of my car, I could stop buying plastic bottles, I could live in a smaller house. I should not compare with other people, I should not say it is good enough, I should do more….\n\nAfter watching the documentary, I have had mixed feelings, a sense of disgust for the human race altogether, for the state of things, a sense of impotence and defenselessness, in a way I think that if we disappeared from the planet it would only be a good thing by judging at what we have been capable of doing evolutionary. That a new race, a better race with a higher degree of consciousness and integrity might come to occupy our planet and do a better job. Then I realise that if I end up lost in these feelings of helplessness nothing would actually change, and that all the negative force that is behind greed, selfishness, rage, anger, violence and hatred would win.\n\nI do not want to find someone above me to blame just to bypass my share of responsibility and find a sense of false security, inner peace by thinking I am doing the right thing, because I am not eating fish or meat etc. It is only by accepting that we are all responsible, we are all parto of the problem that things could actually start changing. It is true someone has more power to make decisions and influence our behaviors and actions but we all have a responsibility to know and understand and change where necessary or appropriate. Every single step matters, sharing what we come to know, discuss with other people, not brainwashing or imposing our points of view but making them see, and feel for themselves. Question our choices, when we buy things, where are these things coming from, is it really necessary to buy that thing, is there a better alternative, more sustainable, more healthy?\n\nHow is it possible to sustain life on earth if we, more than 7.6 billion of people, keep consuming as we do, eating as we do, keep spending as we do, Is there a better alternative? What is the impact of my choices? I am not saying that we should all become vegan or vegetarian, or stop travelling but we should start asking questions, as kids do, very simple questions because often we do what we do out of ignorance. Start questioning when we buy fish or meat from supermarkets or the big distribution, where is this coming from and at what cost for the environment, let alone my health? Is it really necessary to consume so much? Same for vegetables, clothes etc. What alternatives do I have, what if I try to implement a little change in my life, maybe once a week or even once a month? What if I influence my friends or family to do the same? What would be the implications of this little change globally if we all did the same? Start from there.\n\nAt the same time, I feel that what is really necessary is being radical and start designing a new way of living and occupying this planet, from the very basic values. We need a new set of values and educate people around that. I feel that all the noise outside, the mass-media, the politicians, all the debates, the screams of different voices and opinions they are all distracting us, shifting our attention and awareness away from the big problems, the real needs, we need to change our f...g distorted values, we need to design a new system of values and from thee build a new society a new economy and so on . We need to change from inside and only then changing the outside would be possible. Till then nothing would be significant.\n\nWe are here for a little time, we share this planet with other creatures, they are all equal to us, we all share a same right to live, breath, be happy, in harmony, I believe we should stop justifying our actions by telling ourselves our same old stories, evolutionary we are meat eaters, we are predators and all that. What about today? now? We kill and destroy our neighbors and ultimately we are inflicting ourselves so much pain and damage by living the way we do, exploiting and killing just for the sake of having a nice, house, car, body, and garden when we are damaging our health, our mind, feeding on negative emotions or seeking instant gratifications. Don’t you feel we must do something now? Especially us, the privileged ones, the rich countries, the educated people, because we US are living at the expenses of other populations, the poor, the disadvantaged ones. And we can all justify our little actions, like  I joined this movement to clean beaches, or that movement on plastic free, all good of course , but is this really enough? is it really significant? what else could I do?\n\nEspecially, watch your inner motive, your inner intention, is it because you really care or is it because you did it just for the sake of feeling good in your ego????  I am sharing my thoughts and my process aloud.\n\nAs I write, reflect and meditate I have come to believe that what is really needed is to cultivate in ourselves a genuine sense of doing and acting out of love, out of love for nature, the animals, the oceans and the lakes, the fish and birds, the plants and minerals, other fellow human beings, and our future generations, we must tune in with this quality of love that we all have and stop justifying ourselves by repeating the same old stories….. Only then our little gestures would matter because I think they would have the potentials of creating a ripple effect capable of influencing other people, of reaching out, and instigating an inner change in others because only out of love there is truth, there is real happiness and freedom.\n\nPlease help me see what else I need to see, what I need to know and understand, Please share your thoughts, reflections, your knowledge, how you feel about all this, how we can all do something more helpful, more useful for the environment, for our society. I would really appreciate to hear your contribution and grow and change with you in this.",

Just a few % of the population making a change can have a profound impact. For example, a few % of people stop buying plastic packaged soaps/detergents and refill containers. The corporations will recognize that they are losing a few % of their revenue and start to offer refill options as well. \n\n“At the same time, I feel that what is really necessary is being radical and start designing a new way of living and occupying this planet, from the very basic values.”\nI hope to someday start a homestead with solar power and growing my own food. I feel that I would be much happier and healthier living that way and the earth as a whole would certainly be much healthier if we all lived that way. \n\n\nI’ll also add that it seems a lot of people don’t want to face reality. I know some very well educated people in my life who really do care about the world and keep up with world news, but don’t bother reading climate related news. A lot of people don’t want to accept that the way we are living is not sustainable at all. The last 100 years on earth is like a person who spends their entire 20s drinking, doing drugs and partying. Their family and their doctor may tell them along the way that they need to change their ways, but they ignore it until they’re in their mid 30s and their health is destroyed. The doctors (scientists) are constantly telling us that this lifestyle is not sustainable, but people don’t pay attention to it or don’t want to accept it.",

I think most of them do not know, or do not want to know or know but prefer to ignore the issues, since this would take them out of their comfort zone and urge them to implement some changes. Changing habits is scary and it is easier to resist unless something deep inside is triggered. That is why I believe it is important to bring these issues to light, share, discuss even if sometimes it may lead to having some uncomfortable or inconvenient discussions. Furthermore, people need to sit down with their discomfort, feel their emotions and allow them to fully come to the surface only then there is hope in our humanity since most of us are living like machines and not human beings.",

I am brand-new to this subject and I was shocked by how much harm we are doing to ourselves. As I was reading the book I was noting down recommendations by the authors for how to avoid toxic chemicals with an eye towards writing some kind of list I could share with my family & close friends.\n\nAfter reading the book I felt like a \"starter list\" would be best to focus on \"Do's & don't's\" as the easiest entry point. Then if people are interested enough, they can choose to take the next step of finding healthy natural organic alternatives.\n\nSo below is my starter list of ways for people to avoid toxic chemicals. **I would love your feedback and critique if you have time. I am especially interested about whether any of my suggestions below are wrong or out of date.**\n\nThank you\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Only use cleaning products that have ingredients you can identify e.g. water, vinegar, baking soda, essential oils. Look for home-made cleaner recipes online.\n* Don't use or purchase carpets, indoor mats, or rugs that are treated with perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Good alternatives to carpets include solid wood, tile, cork or natural linoleum flooring\n* If you do choose to have carpet, opt for natural materials\n* When selecting area rugs, choose wool or natural plant materials. Look for materials such as jute, seagrass or sisal, and natural rubber nonskid padding.\n* Use low-VOC adhesives to install carpets\n* Regardless of flooring, use doormats and don't wear shoes indoors. Taking off your shoes will prevent tracking in dirt and pollutants.\n* Avoid stain or waterproofing treatments on your carpets\n* Vacuum all carpets and rugs thoroughly using a machine with a HEPA filter at least once a week\n* Don't use shoe polishes and carpet cleaners containing trichloroethylene (TCE)\n* Wipe surfaces of dust using a wet cloth or mop\n* Don't use plastic containers for food storage. Use glass, stainless steel, ceramic, or porcelain containers with tops or aluminium foil.\n* Never reheat food in plastic in the microwave. Transfer it to a plate or a bowl.\n* Don't use nonstick cookware. Switch to cast-iron pots & pans or stainless steel. Also consider ceramic, porcelain, anodized aluminium cookware, or glass bakeware.\n* Only drink water that has already been filtered for toxic chemicals & microplastics\n* Use glass or stainless steel for drink bottles\n* Avoid black plastic cooking utensils\n* Don't use a plastic reusable cup or a bamboo reusable cup. Choose a stainless steel, ceramic, porcelain or glass reusable cup.\n* Eat a home-cooked fresh food diet. Choose fresh ingredients such as loose fruit and loose vegetables. Buy from bulk stores where you can refill your own containers.\n* Buy organic seasonal locally-grown food\n* if you are unable to buy organic food 100% of the time, avoid eating non-organic products which contain the highest amounts of pesticide residues such as lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and apples\n* Avoid packaged food or drink such as plastic bottles, food wrapped in plastic wrap, takeaways in fast food containers, food packaged in greaseproof lining, canned foods, packaging labelled with recycling codes 3 or 7\n* Reduce your consumption of canned food\n* Don't eat fast food\n* Don't eat microwave popcorn\n* Don't drink out of cans\n* To avoid exposure to dioxins (a harmful chemical) eat a vegan diet. More than 90% of human exposure to dioxins is through food, mainly meat and dairy products, fish and shellfish.\n* If you do want to eat meat, avoid processed meat. Choose hormone-free beef and hormone-free dairy.\n* If you do want to eat fish, choose fish with the lowest toxic chemical content\n* Use period products that are plastic-free, unscented, and labelled \"totally chlorine free (TCF)\"\n* Where possible use reusable period products such as silicon cups, reusable pads, reusable tampon applicators, and period pants/period underwear\n* Don't use anti-mold paints in the home\n* Don't wear face masks and other personal protective equipment containing nanographene and other nanoparticles\n* Buy non-toxic sunscreen and non-toxic baby sunscreen\n* Buy children's toys that are labelled phthalate-free, PVC-free, BPA-free, BPS-free, and BPF-free\n* Avoid children's toys that smell strongly of chemicals or are heavily scented.\n* Avoid soft plastic children's toys, as these can contain endocrine disruptors like phthalates.\n* Choose natural rubber children's toys\n* If a children's toy is painted or treated with varnish or other coatings, make sure it is non-toxic, free from lead, and meant for children\n* When furnishing the playroom, include natural materials whenever possible. Choose wooden tables and chairs, with cushions if desired, and baskets, rather than plastic bins, to hold children's toys and art supplies\n* Unpack any new children's toy and leave it outdoors to let some of the hazardous chemicals evaporating\n* Buy solid wooden children's toys with as few glued parts as possible\n* Buy unvarnished and painted children's toys wherever possible or watch out for non-toxic and natural finishes\n* Don't buy school uniforms that have PFAS-based stain resistance (check the labels before you buy)\n* Don't use face paint with toxic ingredients on children\n* Buy nappies that are chemical free. Opt for organic cotton, fragrance-free, and reusable nappies\n* Don't use personal care or beauty products that contain toxic chemicals. Buy certified 100% organic products packaged in glass or ceramic jars that are labelled paraben free, fragrance free, and perfume free.\n* Use PFAS-free dental floss\n* When buying abroad or online, be aware the same product can contain harmful chemicals depending on where you buy it\n* If you live outside the EU, choose products that are sold in the EU. The EU has the strictest chemical regulations in the world, and so these cosmetics may have fewer harmful chemicals in them.\n* Don't use nail varnish and nail remover\n* Don't purchase or use products with the ingredients 'fragrance' or 'parfum'\n* Don't use vinyl shower curtains\n* Don't use scented candles or antibacterial soap\n* Don't use air fresheners\n* Purchase items & products that are free of PBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers) and other harmful plastics\n* Buy products free of free of flame-retardant chemicals and toxic adhesives (such as those containing formaldehyde)\n* Choose natural-wood tables and cabinets that are made without synthetic wood or particleboard\n* Buy organic-cotton mattress pads, not ones with the plastic barriers that will release their own chemicals into the air\n* Don't buy clothes that are treated with fluorinated chemicals called PFAS to make them waterproof or stain resistant\n* Don't use synthetic pesticides, herbicides, and synthetic fertilisers\n* Use organic fertiliser (home-made or store-bought) e.g. use grass clippings as fertiliser on your lawn\n* Avoid handling till receipts as much as possible\n* Don't put till receipts in the recycling bin – because they can contaminate the entire recycling stream\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Check suspect ingredients in hair sprays, nail polishes, hair dyes, shampoos, body wash products, body creams, moisturisers, make-ups, soaps, lipsticks, deodorants, antiperspirants, cleaning products, and fragrances against the SIN List ([https://sinlist.chemsec.org/](https://sinlist.chemsec.org/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* As a rule it's best to avoid products labelled as having anti-microbial properties\n* Use mobile apps to identify toxic chemicals: In Germany, France and the UK, you can use apps to identify cosmetics containing chemicals that you should avoid. In Germany, use Tox Fox, in France use Clean Beauty, and in the UK try Giki ([https://gikibadges.com/](https://gikibadges.com/)).",

        "text": "10 Reasons To Go Vegan\n\n*“To get mud off your hands, use soap and water. To get blood off your hands, go vegan.” -John Sakars*\n\nVegans are like adults. At first, you hate them, then you become one and realize they were right all along. Veganism is a way to drastically reduce suffering for humans and animals, as well as your impact on the environment, and your risk of developing serious ailments. “*There is no fundamental difference between man and animals in their ability to feel pleasure and pain, happiness, and misery.” -Charles Darwin.* Veganism is one of the most effective ways to help combat animal cruelty. Refusing to pay for animal products lowers demand, reducing the number of animals being bred to suffer and die on farms and in slaughterhouses. Here are ten of the many reasons to go vegan. \n\n10. Health\n\n*“People eat meat and think they will become as strong as an ox, forgetting that the ox eats grass.” -Pino Caruso*\n\nGoing vegan lowers the risk of chronic diseases and illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, multiple cancers, dementia, osteoporosis, diabetes, and high blood pressure, to name a few. Veganism is the only known diet that can fully cure “irreversible” conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease. Vegans who follow a wholefoods plant-based diet also tend to live longer, 9.5 years longer for women and 6.1 for men.\n\n9. Water Use\n\n*“We are, quite literally, gambling with the future of our planet- for the sake of hamburgers.” -Peter Singer*\n\nA pound of beef needs 1,799 gallons of water, 576 gallons for a single pound of pork, 518 gallons for a single pound of chicken, 628 litres for one litre of milk, and 53 gallons for a single egg. That's a significant amount of water. It's no surprise that we have so many droughts! Not to mention the fact that 790 million people do not have access to clean water if they have any at all.\n\n8. Resource use\n\n*“Basically we should stop doing those things that are destructive to the environment, other creatures, and ourselves and figure out new ways of existing.”-Moby*         \n\nEven though the world's cattle eat enough food to meet the nutritional needs of 8.7 billion people, one of every nine people – 795 million – suffers from chronic malnutrition. People from Africa, for example, import grain rather than use it for food, and receive only small amounts of money or meat in exchange. Global hunger would be eradicated if we stopped breeding 80 billion animals into life.\n\n7. Land Use\n\n*“By eating meat we share the responsibility of climate change, the destruction of our forests, and the poisoning of our air and water. The simple act of becoming a vegetarian will make a difference in the health of our planet.” -Thích Nhất Hạnh*  \n\nAnimals or the food they consume occupy 40 percent of the land on the planet. They need space for this, which explains the widespread deforestation. Although soy is the primary cause of forest degradation, more than 70% of it is fed to livestock in factory farms. The use of vast amounts of land by grazing cattle is the second most important factor. Animal agriculture is responsible for 91 percent of deforestation.\n\n6. Ocean\n\n*“Nothing will benefit human health and increase chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet.” -Albert Einstei*n\n\nDue to overfishing, the oceans are expected to be depleted by 2048. Our oceans are being increasingly polluted with plastic, with fishing nets being the primary source. Dead zones and acidification are caused by bacteria from pig urine dumped into the ocean. The annual death toll of marine animals is so high that it is only estimated in tonnes. (1,600,000 tonnes)\n\n5. Climate Change\n\n*“Not eating animal products for breakfast and lunch saves 1.3 metric tons of carbon emissions per year.”-Jonathan Safran Foer*\n\nWe are all aware that CO2 is bad for the environment, but it pales in comparison to methane, which is 84 times worse. What, therefore, are the primary sources of methane emissions? Agriculture of animals. Our greed to consume farm animals is directly responsible for 71% of methane emissions. Animal agriculture is the leading source of GHG, accounting for 31% of total GHG emissions. This does not include the amount produced from transportation.\n\n4. Human Rights\n\n*“As long as man continues to be the ruthless destroyer of lower living beings he will never know health or peace. For as long as men massacre animals, they will kill each other. Indeed, he who sows the seed of murder and pain cannot reap joy and love. -Pythagoras*\n\nThe shocking unmeasurable emotional toll of working in a slaughterhouse and the mental health issues that come with it. The poor conditions. Minimum wage. Lack of jobs. Child labour. Crime rates. All of these issues are specifically related to animal agriculture and are cause for concern. Due to a lack of jobs as immigrants, people are hired to kill such gentle and loving creatures and are forced to suppress their emotions. Domestic violence, social isolation, anxiety, substance and alcohol abuse, and PTSD are all possible outcomes of this emotional dissonance. Another study shows that towns with slaughterhouses have higher crime rates. According to another study, cities with slaughterhouses have higher crime rates. These individuals are forced to suffer while only receiving minimum wage. When it comes to child labour, most leather is produced in China or India, where children are regularly exposed to cancer-causing chemicals as they are required to soak leather in large tanks. Children have also been known to collect silk by boiling cocoons with caterpillars inside, often resulting in serious burns.\n\n3. The Egg Industry\n\n*“Animals are sick and in crowded, prison-like conditions to make dairy and eggs. It doesn’t take a lot to draw the line from how we treat animals to how we treat humans.” -Natalie Portman*\n\nMany people believe that eggs are harmless and therefore may consider being vegetarian. Let's begin at the beginning. Chicks are born in a hatchery and thrown onto a conveyor belt. Workers will separate the males from the females, each being thrown onto a separate conveyer belt. The girls are dropped in crates, but the boys are subjected to a far more egregious fate. The male chicks, as well as any weak or deformed birds, are thrown into a macerator, an industrial mincer, where they are destroyed. The SPCA has deemed this method of disposal \"humane.\" The girls are transported to a factory farm, where they will spend the rest of their lives in either battery cages, which are about the size of an A4 sheet of paper and hold four to twelve chickens, or small enclosed sheds to be labeled \"free-run.\" With free-run chickens, though they aren't in these battery cages, they don't have access to the outdoors. What about free-range eggs? These chickens live in the same conditions as free-run chickens, with one minor exception. People feel better about themselves after purchasing them. All that is required for a \"free-range\" label is a space large enough to allow 5,000 chickens out of 50,000 to have access to the outdoors. After all this suffering at just eighteen months old, they are trucked to the slaughterhouse and killed.\n\n2. The Dairy Industry\n\n*“We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow and steal her baby, even though her cries of anguish are unmistakable. Then we take her milk that's intended for her calf. And we put it in our coffee and our cereal. “ -Joaquin Phoenix*\n\nThe dairy industry, like the egg industry, is inherently cruel. Like humans, cows are strongly maternal beings who need to be pregnant to produce milk. To produce sperm, a bull must have an electro-ejaculator, which is essentially a cow dildo, shoved up his anus. That semen is injected into the cow while a fist is shoved in her anus to hold her cervix in place. After carrying her calf for nine long months she will give birth. Within the first twenty-four hours, her baby will be torn away from her. She’ll pine and cry out for days or even weeks, sometimes in the next barn, able to hear them cry but unable to reach them. If her calf is a boy, he will be considered waste and will either be killed on the spot, sent to slaughter at five days old, or forced to live in veal crates for twenty-one weeks. If she is a girl, she will be subjected to the same mental torment as her mother. This process will be repeated five to seven times before her milk production begins to decline or she collapses from exhaustion, at which point she will be trucked off and slaughtered.\n\n1. The Animals\n\n*“The problem is that humans have victimized animals to such a degree that they are not even considered victims. They are not even considered at all. They are nothing; they don’t count; they don’t matter. They are commodities like TV sets and cell phones. We have actually turned animals into inanimate objects – sandwiches and shoes.” Gary Yourofsky*\n\nThe three most commonly consumed animals are as follows: pork (36%), chicken (33%), and beef (24%). So I'm going to start with the pork industry and go over the legal and cruel practices that make the meat industry inconceivable.\n\n1. Pork\n\n*“When I see bacon, I see a pig, I see a little friend, and that’s why I can’t eat it. Simple as that.” -Paul McCartney*\n\nThe majority of pigs bred for food are born into a gestation crate, a small central cage system that allows the piglets to feed on the sow while preventing her from moving around. The pigs are kept on metal grates, which cause pressure sores on the sow's skin due to the hard surfaces. As the sow's body becomes less capable of producing the large litters encouraged by the industry, the number of stillborn and mummified piglets increases with each litter. 10% to 18% of piglets born alive will not make it to weaning age, succumbing to disease, starvation, dehydration, or being accidentally crushed by their trapped mothers. The runts of the litter, who are deemed financially unviable and killed by staff using a method known as \"thumping,\" are included in the death toll. When a runt is thumped, their back legs are lifted and their head is slammed against the hard concrete. Pigs that make it through the first few days are mutilated without anesthetics, their tails and teeth cut to prevent cannibalism, and pieces cut from their ears or tags punched in as a means of identification. As they age they are moved into grower pens. Overcrowded, bored, and frustrated, they resort to cannibalism. They will stay in these pens for six months until they are sent to slaughter. At the slaughterhouse, pigs are crowded together in a truck, going hours and sometimes days with no protection from the extreme weather and with no food or water. When they arrive the pigs are placed in small concrete pens where food and water are denied. When the pigs arrive, they are placed in small concrete pens where they are denied food and water. Using an electric prodder, pigs are herded to the kill floor. Co2 gas chambers are the most common method of stunning, and they are used by all large pig abattoirs. This is deemed as the most \"humane\" method. The system of rotating cages lowers the fully-conscious pigs two or three at a time into the heavily concentrated gas, which begins to burn their eyes, nostrils, sinuses, throat and lungs while suffocating them. Lower concentrations would be less painful but would take more time and is therefore deemed as economically unviable. \n\n1. Chicken\n\n*“The soul is the same in all living creatures, although the body of each is different.” -Hippocrates*\n\nChickens bred for food begin their lives in a hatchery. Even though the industry uses both males and females, macerators are still used for weak or deformed birds that are unlikely to make it to slaughter age. The chicks are housed in large sheds that can hold anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000 birds. The mortality rate is 4-6% within the first week, resulting in 1,600-3,600 dead chicks per shed. The vast majority of these chicks will have been found dead by workers, killed, or discarded alive. Selective breeding, lack of exercise, artificial lighting and heavy antibiotic use which enhance food absorption have resulted in broiler chickens growing at an unnatural speed and weight, reaching 3kg in just 35 days versus the natural peak of 2 kg in 96 days. Their bodies are unable to withstand the extreme pressure and collapse under their weight. These sheds are not cleaned through the entire cycle and the build-up of feces causes high levels of ammonia which burns their eyes, nose, skin, and lungs. SPCA approved simply means they have a single perch running down the middle, but other than that conditions are identical. Depopulation occurs at night when the birds calmest. They're crammed into small plastic cages and loaded onto trucks to be slaughtered. They are hung roughly by their feet onto an automated shackle line. They are lowered into a bath of electrified water to stun them before their throats are slit by an automated blade, but if they lift their heads, they can miss the stun bath, facing the blade fully conscious and ultimately drowning in scalding water further down the process.\n\n1. Beef\n\n*“Part of my becoming a vegetarian was that I would look at my burger, then look at my dogs, and I wasn’t able to see a difference.” -Kristen Bell*\n\nCalves raised for beef are subjected to several painful procedures that are performed without anesthesia, including disbudding, dehorning, ear tagging, castration, and hot iron branding. Beef sold in major supermarkets comes from cattle that have spent their lives in barren feedlots, where they are fattened up with grain or grass before being slaughtered at the age of eighteen months. They are forced into a knock box at the slaughterhouse, where they try desperately to escape. The captive bolt gun is a gun that penetrates the cow's skull to stun it, but smaller guns, in particular, are frequently ineffective against such large animals, causing only pain and limited movement rather than unconsciousness. After stunning, they are chained by their back leg and hoisted upside down, where their throats are slit and they are bled out. \n\n*“I personally chose to go vegan because I educated myself on factory farming and cruelty to animals, and I suddenly realized that what was on my plate were living things, with feelings. And I just couldn’t disconnect myself from it any longer.” -Ellen DeGeneres* \n\nWar has claimed the lives of 619 million people throughout history. Every three days, we kill the same number of animals, and this does not include the deaths of fish and other marine creatures, which are only measured in tonnes. Before we kill them, we must first breed them. Confine and exploit them for food, entertainment, clothing, and science. Their entire lives, from birth to death, are dominated by profit-driven industries. An empire built on pain and bloodshed. Paid for by consumers who are told that their treatment was ethical. Free-range, organic, and local. That their deaths were humane, that animal cruelty does not exist in our country, and that if it does, our government, our authorities, will track it down and put an end to it. And we, as consumers, have no reason to believe otherwise, because eating and using animals is normal to us; we've done it forever. The products on supermarket shelves are so far removed from the individuals who once existed, some only briefly, and others for years without relief. Individuals who share our capacity to feel love like us and the companion animals we adore. Who share with us, our capacity to suffer. Our desire to live, to be free, to be recognized for who we are as individuals rather than as objects or for our utility to others. They are beings in our own right, not production units. Not stock, Not \"it,\" but \"he,\" \"she,\" and \"they.\" The truth is that killing someone who wants to live cannot be done humanely. It's not a matter of treatment or finding better ways to do the wrong thing. Larger cages, lower stocking densities, or less painful gas. We tell ourselves that they have lived good lives, and in the end, they don’t know what’s coming and don’t feel a thing. But they do. In their final hours, minutes and seconds, there is always fear, there is always pain. The smells of blood. The screaming of other members of their species, with whom they have shared their lives. Never a willingness or desire to die, but rather, desperation to live, a frantic fight to their last breath. And never are they shown mercy or kindness, instead mocked, laughed at, kicked, beaten, tossed like ragdolls, or sent into a mincer because they were born the wrong sex. We take their children. We take their freedom. We take their lives, sending them into slaughterhouses healthy and whole, only to emerge as packaged pieces on the other side, and we tell ourselves that something humane and ethical happened along the way. We harm ourselves in the process. We devastate the environment by emitting more greenhouse gases from animal agriculture than any other industry, destroying our forests and slaughtering our native animals to make way for farms. Despite this, we continue to justify animal agriculture as normal, necessary, and natural. That the animal kingdom, or certain species within it, are inferior to us because they lack our specific type of intelligence, are weaker, and are incapable of self-defence. We believe that because of our apparent superiority, we have earned the right to exercise power, authority, and dominion over those we perceive to be inferior, to further our own short-sighted goals. It's a rationale that's been used before. To enslave the blacks or to take their land and children by the white man. To assassinate Jews by the Nazis. To silence and oppress women by men. Are we doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past? Is our species defined by this superiority complex, this pure selfishness? Or are we capable of something more?\n\nVeganism isn't as difficult as some people believe, and it doesn't make you sick or weak. It's simply a choice you make to improve your health and prevent the unnecessary slaughter of animals. It is not necessary to eat meat to survive—or even thrive. “*It takes nothing away from a human to be kind to an animal.” -Joaquin Phoenix.* It's past time for you to put yourself and your preferences aside because there are more important things at stake. *“If you think that being vegan is difficult, imagine being a factory farmed animal.” -Davegan Raza*\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [PubMed: Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Vegetarian Diets](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27886704/)\n* [University of Oxford: Plant-based foods are good for both health and the environment](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2019-10-29-plant-based-foods-are-good-both-health-and-environment)\n* [Harvard University: Vegan diet can benefit both health and the environment](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/vegan-diet-health-environment/)\n* [Journal of Environmental and Public Health: Reducing the Environmental Impact of Dietary Choice: Perspectives from a Behavioural and Social Change Approach](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jeph/2012/978672/)\n* [NCBI: The effects of plant-based diets on the body and the brain: a systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6742661/)\n* [BBC: Confessions of a slaughterhouse worker](https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-50986683)\n* [SURGE: THE DISTURBING LINK BETWEEN SLAUGHTERHOUSE WORKERS AND PTSD](https://www.surgeactivism.org/articles/slaughterhouse-workers-and-ptsd)\n* [The Yale: A Call to Action: Psychological Harm in Slaughterhouse Workers](https://yaleglobalhealthreview.com/2016/01/25/a-call-to-action-psychological-harm-in-slaughterhouse-workers/)\n* [PubMed: Prevalence of serious psychological distress among slaughterhouse workers at a United States beef packing plant](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28506017/)\n* [Farm Transparency Project: Dominion Movement](https://www.dominionmovement.com/watch)\n* [National Earth: Earthlings](http://www.nationearth.com/)\n* [Joey Carbstrong: Violated](https://vimeo.com/398315611)\n* [Joey Carbstrong: Milk: Make Your Own Mind Up](https://todayomg.com/milk-make-your-own-mind-up-2021-full-documentary/)\n* [What The Health](https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/80174177)\n* [The Game Changers](https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/81157840)\n* [Cowspiracy](https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/80033772)\n* [Seaspiracy](https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/81014008)",

Please don't post preachy and naive stuff like this, if anything it pushes people further away and you become exactly what you describe; the vegan that people dislike. Lowering carbon footprint is important, but so is being realistic about it.\n\nThe very first one, Health, is already hopefully one sided and with no nuance. There are plenty of people who cannot simply change to a vegan diet for health reasons. If you are highly active with a large muscle mass it is already so incredibly challenging and expensive that it is ridiculous to implement in everyday life, just the sheer volume of food they have to eat is crazy. There are also several health conditions where purely vegan food will make life incredibly difficult and you will have to take a load of supplements.\n\nEating vegan is also a luxury that many can't afford. While you may live on a homestead or in some big city with numerous options, many cannot physically get to or afford the food needed to live properly on vegan food. Many rural areas in the world have very limited food options.\n\nI'm sorry but I think this is the one time I'll pull the \"check your privilege\" card.",

        "text": "Let's assume the dog poop bags I throw out end up in a landfill that does not capture methane gas through a gas collection system, and that methane is released into the atmosphere.\n\nLet's also assume there's very little oxygen where my dog poop bags end up in this landfill (~1%).\n\nWhich is better for the environment: bioplastic poop bags, or oxo-biodegradable poop bags?\n\nOxo-biodegradable plastic requires oxygen to degrade, so if there's very little oxygen my dog poop bag will degrade at a very, very slow rate.  However, degradation of this plastic doesn't create methane, and microbes consume the plastic once it's reduced to a certain molecular weight (further degrading it into carbon dioxide, water, and biomass).. but it will take a very long time before the plastic is reduced to this weight if it has exposure to such low levels of oxygen.\n\nBioplastic doesn't require oxygen to degrade, and can be degraded by microbes.  So the bioplastic will degrade at a much faster rate than oxo-biodegradable plastic.  However, degradation produces methane, which contributes to climate change.\n\nI'm currently leaning towards oxo-biodegradable plastic and here's why:\n\n1.  There's a lot of theories that microplastics in landfills can leak out into the environment, polluting our soil.  However, according to ScienceDirect, there's very little empirical evidence to support this:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004313541930377X\n\n2.  The other concern with plastics in landfills are the toxins that are leaked into the environment.  However, oxo-biodegradable plastic that meets biodegradable standards biodegrade with no toxicity.. so it seems that there aren't toxins produced by this type of plastic during the degradation process.\n\n3.  Methane is considered to be the second largest contributor to climate change, after carbon dioxide.  Oxo-biodegradable plastic does not produce methane in the degradation process.  While oxo-biodegradable plastic pollution is no doubt an issue since it can harm wildlife, and it produces carbon dioxide when it's decomposed by microbes, it seems that bioplastic in the landfill will be a greater contributor to climate change than oxo-biodegradable plastic due to the creation and release of methane into the atmosphere.\n\nIn short, it seems that a bioplastic poop bag would contribute more to climate change than an oxo-biodegradable poop bag (in this specific situation).  Please feel free to correct any of the above.",

        "text": "People define renewable energy to include or exclude hydro, nuclear, biomass etc. which serves only to cloud the picture. Most graphs show you how fast each energy source is growing, but they do not add them all up for a simple comparison\n\n[When people say we can have 50% renewable power by 2040, they don't tell you that electricity is some 20% of global energy ](https://www.google.com/search?q=2050+%3A+28%25+of+global+energy+will+be+renewable%2C+at+best&rlz=1C1EXJR_enCA869CA869&oq=2050+%3A+28%25+of+global+energy+will+be+renewable%2C+at+best&aqs=chrome..69i57&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)\n\nWhen people say 50% of all new car sales will be EV by 2040, they don't tell you what percentage of total cars will actually be EV\n\nIf a wind turbine produces 90% of its power 25% of the time, they say it produces its average power 40% of the time. It's a numbers game\n\nCharts presented as insight often hide a how much renewable will be of total energy use, like the simple truth seen in the CNBC link below\n\n[By 2040 renewable energy will be less than 20% of global energy](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/12/global-energy-demand-will-keep-world-burning-fossil-fuels-agency-says.html)\\- CNBC 2019 - see simple clear chart near top of page\n\nThe Wall Street Journal used BP's 2040 projections for a simple renewable  chart in a Saudi IPO threat assessment presentation on YouTube\n\nThe WSJ, the Saudis, BP and Google's YT don't mess around when it comes to trillion dollar IPOs, so they use a simple chart based on the best data. This chart is the renewable energy threat assessment for a trillion dollar OIL deal. People are very forthcoming in such deals, hence the simple clear charts.

Gas cars are going to coexist with EVs for a long time, just as those so-called clunkers coexisted with hybrids. While I don't doubt that straight up gas bans may eventually come (probably to large cities first), all we're talking about now is a 1-3 decade phase-out of _new_ gas cars. I'd even hazard that we'd get there without government intervention, but this intervention can be what pushes the battery industry to make the necessary breakthroughs needed to become more sustainable. \n\nIs the car industry getting ahead of itself/the battery industry? Perhaps, but I do think that it can work out for the better. Just look at what Tesla is doing, progressing to cobalt-free and supposedly on their way to a million mile battery. Battery technology (not just for cars) is imperative to long term sustainability and imagining the field 20 years from now with the same lens as today seems a bit unnecessarily pessimistic.\n\nI'd just like to add too that your second point is essentially the whole \"China pollutes more than the US so why should we care\" argument dressed up in industry rather than nationalism, not much better. Do we really expect - or want - the auto industry to throw up their hands and say, \"well, progress be damned - we're not changing until the aviation industry changes\"??\n\nIf we want to stop climate change, we need a multifaceted approach that doesn't turn a blind eye to certain industries and addresses things from every level of the supply chain, right down to culture and society itself. i.e. For transportation, we're talking about increasing efficiency of vehicles people WILL use, making them last longer, investing in mass transit and micromobility, improving development to decrease transportation needs, etc, etc.",

Doubt it.\n\nThere's amazing research and even applications of carbon neutral hydrocarbon fuels now. Seems to me like we should be plowing billions into this, as well as funding battery technology. If we can carbon neutralise the entire shipping and aerospace industry without rebuilding all our infrastructure and engines, then that's a crazy dent in the emissions, compared to the slow burner of migrating all our cars to batteries, and the pollution all that produces.",

and/or chemical in nature. The latter include the leaching from plastics of carcinogenic and endocrine-disrupting contaminants, such as monomers, plastic additives and polymer-associated chemicals. In addition, due to their large surface area to volume ratio, small-scale plastic particles can become heavily contaminated.\n\n[Nine Things to Know About Microplastics](https://www.maritime-executive.com/blog/nine-things-to-know-about-microplastics) – Maritime Executive 2020\n\n[Microplastics pose a threat to plants](https://www.botany.one/2019/03/microplastics-could-pose-a-threat-to-plants/) – Botany One 2019\n\n* Surfaces could allow toxic substances to accumulate in ways that they couldn’t in organic soil with one of the big problems being biodegradable plastics.

Many serious diseases are characterized by an overproduction of free radicals in cells. This applies to cancer and neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.Researchers warn that a combination of nanoparticles and contaminants may form a cocktail that is harmful to our cells. In their study, 72% of cells died after exposure to a cocktail of nano-silver and cadmium ions. We should **not** look at nanoparticles isolated when we investigate and discuss the effects, they may have on our health.\n\n[Nanoparticles more harmful than we think](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/08/180820094450.htm) – Science Daily 2018\n\n* We need to take cocktail effects into account, said Professor Frank Kjeldsen, Dept of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, SDU, adding: Products with nano particles are being developed and manufactured every day, but in most countries there are no regulations, so there is no way of knowing what and how many nanoparticles are being released into the environment.

Titanium nanoparticles can induce inflammation due to oxidative stress. They can also have a genotoxic effect leading to, among others, apoptosis or chromosomal instability. After inhalation or oral exposure, titanium nanoparticles accumulate in, among other places, the lungs, alimentary tract, liver, heart, spleen, kidneys and cardiac muscle.

        "text": "If you care about our future generations, it is truly unbelievable what the EPA, the Interior Department, the National Park Service and other parts of government are doing to revise, weaken, and rollback so many of the gains our country has made in advancing clean air, clean water, global warming, emissions, & other environmental protections!  \nAfter reading about the 64 completed rollbacks & 34 still in progress, we fear for the future of our coming generations as well as the health of our planet!!!!  \nHere’s a listing of the 98 rollbacks/changes that will affect us all…..\n\nBe afraid! Be very afraid!!!!\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\n•Air pollution and emissions  \nCompleted  \n1. Weakened Obama-era fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for passenger cars and light trucks.  \nE.P.A. and Transportation Department  \n2. Revoked California’s power to set stricter tailpipe emissions standards than the federal government.  \nE.P.A.  \n3. Withdrew the legal justification for an Obama-era rule that limited mercury emissions from coal power plants.  \nE.P.A.  \n4. Replaced the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which would have set strict limits on carbon emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants, with a new version that would let states set their own rules.  \nExecutive Order; E.P.A.  \n5. Canceled a requirement for oil and gas companies to report methane emissions.  \nE.P.A.  \n6. Revised and partially repealed an Obama-era rule limiting methane emissions on public lands, including intentional venting and flaring from drilling operations.  \nInterior Department  \n7. Loosened a Clinton-era rule designed to limit toxic emissions from major industrial polluters.  \nE.P.A.  \n8. Revised a program designed to safeguard communities from increases in pollution from new power plants to make it easier for facilities to avoid emissions regulations.  \nE.P.A.  \n9. Amended rules that govern how refineries monitor pollution in surrounding communities.  \nE.P.A.  \n10. Weakened an Obama-era rule meant to reduce air pollution in national parks and wilderness areas.  \nE.P.A.  \n11. Weakened oversight of some state plans for reducing air pollution in national parks.  \nE.P.A.  \n12. Relaxed air pollution regulations for a handful of plants that burn waste coal for electricity.  \nE.P.A.  \n13. Repealed rules meant to reduce leaking and venting of powerful greenhouse gases known as hydrofluorocarbons from large refrigeration and air conditioning systems.  \nE.P.A.  \n14. Directed agencies to stop using an Obama-era calculation of the social cost of carbon that rule-makers used to estimate the long-term economic benefits of reducing carbon dioxide emissions.  \nExecutive Order  \n15. Withdrew guidance directing federal agencies to include greenhouse gas emissions in environmental reviews. But several district courts have ruled that emissions must be included in such reviews.  \nExecutive Order; Council on Environmental Quality  \n16. Revoked an Obama executive order that set a goal of cutting the federal government’s greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent over 10 years.  \nExecutive Order  \n17. Repealed a requirement that state and regional authorities track tailpipe emissions from vehicles on federal highways.  \nTransportation Department  \n18. Lifted a summertime ban on the use of E15, a gasoline blend made of 15 percent ethanol. (Burning gasoline with a higher concentration of ethanol in hot conditions increases smog.)  \nE.P.A.  \n19. Changed rules to allow states and the E.P.A. to take longer to develop and approve plans aimed at cutting methane emissions from existing landfills.  \nE.P.A.  \nIn Progress  \n20. Submitted notice of intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. (The process of withdrawing cannot be completed until November 2020.)  \nExecutive Order  \n21. Proposed relaxing Obama-era requirements that companies monitor and repair methane leaks at oil and gas facilities.  \nE.P.A.  \n22. Proposed eliminating Obama-era restrictions that, in effect, required newly built coal power plants to capture carbon dioxide emissions.  \nE.P.A.  \n23. Proposed revisions to standards for carbon dioxide emissions from new, modified and reconstructed power plants.  \nExecutive Order; E.P.A.  \n24. Began a review of emissions rules for power plant start-ups, shutdowns and malfunctions. One outcome of that review: In February 2020, E.P.A. reversed a requirement that Texas follow emissions rules during certain malfunction events.  \nE.P.A.  \n25. Opened for comment a proposal limiting the ability of individuals and communities to challenge E.P.A.-issued pollution permits before a panel of agency judges.  \nE.P.A.  \n26. Delayed issuing a rule limiting greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft. (The E.P.A. acknowledged it is legally required to issue the rule, but has not done so yet. The delay is being challenged by environmental groups.)  \nE.P.A.  \n27. Proposed limiting pesticide application buffer zones that are intended to protect farmworkers and bystanders from accidental exposure.  \nE.P.A.  \n\\---------------------------------------  \n•Drilling and Extraction  \nCompleted  \n28. Made significant cuts to the borders of two national monuments in Utah and recommended border and resource-management changes to several more.  \nPresidential Proclamation; Interior Department  \n29. Lifted ban on drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  \nCongress; Interior Department | Read more »  \n30. Rescinded water pollution regulations for fracking on federal and Indian lands.  \nInterior Department  \n31. Scrapped a proposed rule that required mines to prove they could pay to clean up future pollution.  \nE.P.A.  \n32. Withdrew a requirement that Gulf oil rig owners prove they can cover the costs of removing rigs once they stop producing.  \nInterior Department  \n33. Approved construction of the Dakota Access pipeline less than a mile from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation after the Army Corps of Engineers had said it would explore alternative routes. (A court has since ruled the agency must investigate how the pipeline is impacting the environment and local tribes, but it can continue to operate in the meantime.)  \nExecutive Order; Army  \n34. Changed how the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission considers the indirect effects of greenhouse gas emissions in environmental reviews of pipelines.  \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission  \n35. Revoked an Obama-era executive order designed to preserve ocean, coastal and Great Lakes waters in favor of a policy focused on energy production and economic growth.  \nExecutive Order  \n36. Permitted the use of seismic air guns for gas and oil exploration in the Atlantic Ocean. The practice, which can kill marine life and disrupt fisheries, was blocked under the Obama administration.  \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  \n37. Loosened offshore drilling safety regulations implemented by the Obama after following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill, including reduced testing requirements for blowout prevention systems.  \nInterior Department  \n38. Lifted an Obama-era freeze on new coal leases on public lands. In April 2019, a judge ruled that the Interior Department could not begin selling new leases without completing an environmental review. In February, the agency published an assessment that concluded restarting federal coal leasing would have little environmental impact.  \nExecutive Order; Interior Department  \nIN PROGRESS  \n39. Proposed opening most of America’s coastal waters to offshore oil and gas drilling but delayed the plan after a federal judge ruled that Mr. Trump’s reversal of an Obama-era ban on drilling in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans was unlawful.  \nInterior Department 40. Repealed an Obama-era rule governing royalties for oil, gas and coal leases on federal lands, which replaced a 1980s rule that critics said allowed companies to underpay the federal government. A federal judge struck down the Trump administration’s repeal. The Interior Department is reviewing the decision.  \nInterior Department 41. Proposed revising regulations on offshore oil and gas exploration by floating vessels in the Arctic that were developed after a 2013 accident. The Interior Department previously said it was “considering full rescission or revision of this rule.”  \nExecutive Order; Interior Department  \n42. Proposed “streamlining” the approval process for drilling for oil and gas in national forests.  \nAgriculture Department; Interior Department | Read more »  \n43. Recommended shrinking three marine protected areas or opening them to commercial fishing.  \nExecutive Order; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 44. Proposed opening more land in the Alaska National Petroleum Reserve for oil drilling. The Obama administration had designated about half of the reserve as a conservation area.  \nInterior Department  \n45. Proposed lifting a Clinton-era policy that banned logging and road construction in Tongass National Forest, Alaska.  \nInterior Department  \n46. Approved the Keystone XL pipeline rejected by President Barack Obama, but a federal judge blocked the project from going forward without an adequate environmental review process. Mr. Trump later attempted to sidestep the ruling by issuing a presidential permit. Initial construction has started, but the project remains tied up in court.  \nExecutive Order; State Department  \n\\------------------------------------  \n•Infrastructure and Planning  \nCompleted  \n47. Revoked Obama-era flood standards for federal infrastructure projects that required the government to account for sea level rise and other climate change effects.  \nExecutive Order  \n48. Relaxed the environmental review process for federal infrastructure projects.  \nExecutive Order  \n49. Revoked a directive for federal agencies to minimize impacts on water, wildlife, land and other natural resources when approving development projects.  \nExecutive Order  \n50. Revoked an Obama executive order promoting climate resilience in the northern Bering Sea region of Alaska, which withdrew local waters from oil and gas leasing and established a tribal advisory council to consult on local environmental issues.  \nExecutive Order  \n51. Reversed an update to the Bureau of Land Management’s public land-use planning process.  \nCongress  \n52. Withdrew an Obama-era order to consider climate change in the management of natural resources in national parks.  \nNational Park Service  \n53. Restricted most Interior Department environmental studies to one year in length and a maximum of 150 pages, citing a need to reduce paperwork.  \nInterior Department  \n54. Withdrew a number of Obama-era Interior Department climate change and conservation policies that the agency said could “burden the development or utilization of domestically produced energy resources.”  \nInterior Department  \n55. Eliminated the use of an Obama-era planning system designed to minimize harm from oil and gas activity on sensitive landscapes, such as national parks.  \nInterior Department  \n56. Withdrew Obama-era policies designed to maintain or, ideally, improve natural resources affected by federal projects.  \nInterior Department  \nIn Progress  \n57. Proposed plans to speed up the environmental review process for Forest Service projects.  \nAgriculture Department  \n\\------------------------------------  \n•Animals  \nCompleted  \n58. Changed the way the Endangered Species Act is applied, making it more difficult to protect wildlife from long-term threats posed by climate change.  \nInterior Department  \n59. Relaxed environmental protections for salmon and smelt in California’s Central Valley in order to free up water for farmers.  \nExecutive Order; Interior Department | Read more »  \n60. Overturned a ban on the use of lead ammunition and fishing tackle on federal lands.  \nInterior Department  \n61. Overturned a ban on the hunting of predators in Alaskan wildlife refuges.  \nCongress  \n62. Amended fishing regulations to loosen restrictions on the harvest of a number of species.  \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  \n63. Proposed revising limits on the number of endangered marine mammals and sea turtles that can be unintentionally killed or injured with sword-fishing nets on the West Coast. (The Obama-era rules were initially withdrawn by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, but were later finalized following a court order. The agency has said it plans to revise the limits.)  \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  \n64. Loosened fishing restrictions intended to reduce bycatch of Atlantic Bluefin Tuna.  \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  \n65. Rolled back a roughly 40-year-old interpretation of a policy aimed at protecting migratory birds, potentially running afoul of treaties with Canada and Mexico.  \nInterior Department  \n66. Overturned a ban on using parts of migratory birds in handicrafts made by Alaskan Natives.  \nInterior Department  \nIn Progress  \n67. Opened nine million acres of Western land to oil and gas drilling by weakening habitat protections for the sage grouse, an imperiled bird. An Idaho District Court injunction temporarily blocked the measure.  \nInterior Department  \n68. Proposed ending an Obama-era rule that barred using bait to lure and kill grizzly bears, among other sport hunting practices that many people consider extreme, on some public lands in Alaska.  \nNational Park Service; Interior Department | Read more »  \n\\------------------------------------  \n•Toxic substances and safety  \nCompleted  \n69. Rejected a proposed ban on chlorpyrifos, a pesticide linked to developmental disabilities in children. (Several states have banned its use and the main manufacturer of the pesticide in 2020 stopped producing the product because of shrinking demand.)  \nE.P.A.  \n70. Narrowed the scope of a 2016 law mandating safety assessments for potentially toxic chemicals like dry-cleaning solvents. The E.P.A. said it would focus on direct exposure and exclude indirect exposure such as from air or water contamination. In November, a court of appeals ruled the agency must widen its scope to consider full exposure risks.  \nE.P.A.  \n71. Reversed an Obama-era rule that required braking system upgrades for “high hazard” trains hauling flammable liquids like oil and ethanol.  \nTransportation Department  \n72. Removed copper filter cake, an electronics manufacturing byproduct comprised of heavy metals, from the “hazardous waste” list.  \nE.P.A.  \n73. Ended an Occupational Safety and Health Administration program to reduce risks of workers developing the lung disease silicosis. In February released guidance to include silica in OSHA's National Emphasis Program, a worker safety program.  \nLabor Department  \n74. Rolled back most of the requirements of a 2017 rule aimed at improving safety at sites that use hazardous chemicals that was instituted after a chemical plant exploded in Texas.  \nE.P.A.  \nIn progress  \n75. Proposed changing safety rules to allow for rail transport of the highly flammable liquefied natural gas.  \nTransportation Department | Read more »  \n76. Announced a review of an Obama-era rule lowering coal dust limits in mines. The head of the Mine Safety and Health Administration said there were no immediate plans to change the dust limit but has extended a public comment period until 2022.  \nLabor Department  \n\\------------------------------------  \n•Water Pollution  \nCompleted  \n77. Scaled back pollution protections for certain tributaries and wetlands that were regulated under the Clean Water Act by the Obama administration.  \nE.P.A.; Army  \n78. Revoked a rule that prevented coal companies from dumping mining debris into local streams.  \nCongress  \n79. Withdrew a proposed rule aimed at reducing pollutants, including air pollution, at sewage treatment plants.  \nE.P.A.  \n80. Withdrew a proposed rule requiring groundwater protections for certain uranium mines. Recently, the administration’s Nuclear Fuel Working Group proposed opening up 1,500 acres outside the Grand Canyon to nuclear production.  \nE.P.A.  \nIn progress  \n81. Attempted to weaken federal rules regulating the disposal and storage of coal ash waste from power plants, but a court determined the rules were already insufficient. Proposed a new rule to allow coal ash impoundments of a type previously deemed unsafe a pathway to proving safety.  \nE.P.A.  \n82. Proposed a rule exempting certain types of power plants from parts of an E.P.A. rule limiting toxic discharge from power plants into public waterways.  \nE.P.A.  \n83. Proposed weakenning a portion of the Clean Water Act to make it easier for the E.P.A. to issue permits for federal projects over state objections if the projects don't meet local water quality standards, including for pipelines and other fossil fuel facilities.  \nExecutive Order; E.P.A.  \n84. Proposed extending the lifespan of unlined coal ash holding areas, which can spill their contents because they lack a protective underlay.  \nE.P.A.  \n85. Proposed a regulation limiting the scope of an Obama-era rule under which companies had to prove that large deposits of recycled coal ash would not harm the environment.  \nE.P.A.  \n86. Proposed a new rule allowing the federal government to issue permits for coal ash waste in Indian Country and some states without review if the disposal site is in compliance with federal regulations.  \nE.P.A. | Read more »  \n87. Proposed doubling the time allowed to remove lead pipes from water systems with high levels of lead.  \nE.P.A.  \n\\------------------------------------  \n•Other  \nCompleted  \n88. Repealed an Obama-era regulation that would have nearly doubled the number of light bulbs subject to energy-efficiency standards starting in January 2020. The E.P.A. also blocked the next phase of efficiency standards for general-purpose bulbs already subject to regulation.  \nEnergy Department  \n89. Changed a 25-year-old policy to allow coastal replenishment projects to use sand from protected ecosystems.  \nInterior Department  \n90. Limited funding of environmental and community development projects through corporate settlements of federal lawsuits.  \nJustice Department  \n91. Stopped payments to the Green Climate Fund, a United Nations program to help poorer countries reduce carbon emissions.  \nExecutive Order  \n92. Reversed restrictions on the sale of plastic water bottles in national parks desgined to cut down on litter, despite a Park Service report that the effort worked.  \nInterior Department  \nIn progress  \n93. Proposed a sweeping overhaul of the National Environmental Policy Act that would limit the scope of environmental concerns federal agencies need to take into account when constructing public infrastructure projects, such as roads, pipelines and telecommunications networks.  \nCouncil on Environmental Quality  \n94. Proposed limiting the studies used by the E.P.A. for rulemaking to only those that make data publicly available. (Scientists widely criticized the proposal, saying it would effectively block the agency from considering landmark research that relies on confidential health data.)  \nE.P.A.  \n95. Proposed changes to the way cost-benefit analyses are conducted under the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and other environmental statutes.  \nE.P.A.  \n96. Proposed withdrawing efficiency standards for residential furnaces and commercial water heaters designed to reduce energy use.  \nEnergy Department  \n97.

        "text": "Did you see the headline that the nation's recycling program was a greenwash fraud fronted by the plastics industry to head off serious action against single use beverage containers etc? Anybody who knows me knows I'm hard green. When I tell you this story remember who's telling it. If you want to see how hard green I am, read this post from 2016.\n\n[No Soil & Water Before 100% Renewable Energy](https://lokisrevengeblog.wordpress.com/2016/01/24/no-soil-water-before-100-renwable-energy/)\n\nWhen Bill McKibben wanted to name 350 dot org, he kept pestering James Hansen for the number he considered safe for CO2 concentrations, Scientists don't like hard numbers, but Bill persisted so James relented. Soon after telling Bill 350, James reconsidered and restated the safe number was 300. Bill didn't care, he already printed the stationary and t-shirts.\n\nBill invited James to a small protest in front of the White House for a promotional photo op.\n\nJames Hansen was promoting 100% private carbon tax dividends, where all the tax money on wealthy people would all go back to the poor. This means zero money for governments and corporations. Well guess who hates that idea? Governments and corporations, especially socialist governments.\n\nImmediately after the photo-op, Senators Barbara Boxer and Bernie Sanders sponsored a bill that would allow the federal government to sequester ( steal ) 40% of any such dividends, effectively gutting Hansen's proposal. Bill McKibben, the Sierra Club, the WWF are all frauds who act as front men for corporations exactly the way TreeHugger works for the logging industry. Europe gets over 50% of its renewable energy burning trees imported from around the world on cargo ships. They are shipped in the form of pellets, so they can ship them cheaper. Cars in Europe burn diesel fuel and 8% of that fuel is made with palm and soy oils. Soy oil is brain toxic.\n\nJames Hansen's proposal is 10 years old and emissions went up 10%.\n\nWe got 10 years to reduce emissions 55% or face hunger, war, thirst and runaway hothouse mass extinction. This is our last chance to do the right thing. 100% private carbon wealth tax dividends will unite the left and right against the rich and reduce emissions faster than any other way. People on the left, like Bill, have been fighting this idea for over 10 years. If you are young, your idealism is being used by NGOs and corporations against your best interest in exactly the same way Trump uses his base. Most of you are too young, stupid or pig headed to see this, which is normal.\n\nThe people who stood silently while televisions ads told you that oxy wasn't addictive, are the same people who say they'll save us from the covid. This are the same people who said that recycling plastic would save the earth, and that 911 was done by the Mujaheddin in Afghanistan.\n\nIf we don't get our shit together and speak with one voice it's over. Bernie Sanders and Trump won't fix anything. Bernie is a sell out traitor and Trump is a lying sack of shit. If Bernie is not a traitor, then why is he fighting for the Democratic Party and not you?\n\n**Water is life. Food is God.**\n\n[Global Report on Food Crises](https://www.developmentaid.org/#!/news-stream/post/63337/global-report-on-food-crises-reveals-scope-of-food-crises-as-covid-19-poses-new-risks-to-vulnerable-countries) \\- Developmentaid\n\n[Food security experts warn of supply shortages, higher prices](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/food-security-covid19-trudeau-1.5520492) \\- CBC\n\n[The Effects of COVID-19 Will Ripple through Food Systems](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-effects-of-covid-19-will-ripple-through-food-systems/) \\- Sciam\n\n[The next global emergency is at the door — a food crisis](https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2020/the-next-global-emergency-is-at-the-door-a-food-crisis/) \\- Poynter\n\n[Chinese officials warn of impending global food crisis](https://thepigsite.com/news/2020/04/chinese-officials-warn-of-impending-global-food-crisis-due-to-covid-19-and-swine-fever) \\- Pigsite\n\n[Coronavirus could double number of people going hungry](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-could-double-number-of-people-going-hungry) \\- Guardian\n\n['Race against time' to prevent famines during coronavirus crisis](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/16/race-against-time-to-prevent-famines-during-coronavirus-crisis) \\- Guardian\n\n[Covid-19 and Food Security ](https://www.csis.org/programs/global-food-security-program/covid-19-and-food-security) \\- CSIS\n\n[UN warns of 'biblical' famine due to Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.france24.com/en/20200422-un-says-food-shortages-due-to-covid-19-pandemic-could-lead-to-humanitarian-catastrophe) \\- France 24\n\n[Tyson Foods takes out full-page ad: ‘The food supply chain is breaking’ ](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/494772-tyson-foods-takes-out-full-page-ad-the-food-supply-chain-is-breaking)The Hill\n\n[COVID-19 will double number of people facing food crises](https://www.wfp.org/news/covid-19-will-double-number-people-facing-food-crises-unless-swift-action-taken) \\- WFP\n\n[Crops at risk as coronavirus lockdown grounds bees](https://www.ft.com/content/0354f35c-e527-45a9-96c8-71c78db5d272) \\- FT\n\n[African Swine Fever Threatens China And Polands Pigs](https://vegannewsnow.com/2020/04/12/poland-china-african-swine-flu/) \\- Vegan News\n\n[How factory farming breeds deadly viruses and epidemics](https://www.lifegate.com/people/lifestyle/factory-farming-epidemics-coronavirus) \\- Lifegate\n\n[Over 820 million people suffering from hunger;

Nanoparticles have been around some 10 years now, and they’re everywhere, good luck avoiding them, they are in our toothpaste, make-up, food etc., they’re even in the air, and travel straight from your nose, to your olfactory nerve, to your brain. They also get into waterways to affect fish.\n\n**Nanoparticles from air leaves magnetic waste in your brain**\n\n[https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/industrial-air-pollution-leaves-magnetic-waste-brain](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/industrial-air-pollution-leaves-magnetic-waste-brain)\n\n**Magnetic Nanoparticles Found In Human Brain**\n\n[https://www.newsweek.com/potentially-toxic-magnetic-nanoparticle-pollution-human-brains-495950](https://www.newsweek.com/potentially-toxic-magnetic-nanoparticle-pollution-human-brains-495950)\n\n*  Magnetite from air pollution gets into the brain to cause Alzheimer-like changes in our youth, in people as young as the teenage years. Magnetite is a particularly concerning pollutant because it forms destructive chemicals called reactive oxygen species, ( free radicals ) which lead to damage and inflammation. The fact that it’s also magnetic could cause interactions with external magnetic fields, which may cause further problems.\n\n**Silica nanoparticles induce neurodegeneration-like changes in behavior, mood dysfunction and cognitive impairment**\n\n[https://particleandfibretoxicology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12989-018-0263-3](https://particleandfibretoxicology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12989-018-0263-3)\n\n* Nanoparticles are often used for drug delivery mechanisms for inside the cells of your body.\n\n**Common food additive found to affect gut microbiota**\n\n[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/05/190513123017.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/05/190513123017.htm)\n\n* Titanium dioxide nanoparticles, found in 900 food products, could trigger diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer.\n\n**Titanium dioxide nanoparticles exacerbates colitis**\n\n[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/07/170719100521.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/07/170719100521.htm)\n\n* Titanium dioxide, one of the most-produced nanoparticles worldwide, is being used increasingly in foodstuffs.

        "text": "Plan for earth\n\nFeel free to skip my ramble to the prompt: \n[My name is Kody, I’m 21 years old, my whole life I’ve had severe depression and as of last month I realized I have adhd. \nI’m on new medication but that’s not what this is...\nI’ve created a concept idea for a non profit company that helps the world. \nI genuinely just want everyone to be happy, no one deserves what I’ve seen. \n\nSo here’s the draft / all notes I’ve managed to force myself to write. \n\n(I don’t care if I’m not the one to do the company. \nHumanity deserves better though. Wether I see it or not. )\n(I also have never felt supported, or as if anyone even wants change, and I can almost guarantee this is only going to get at the most 10 up votes if not in the negatives)]\n\nEverything company non profit draft \n\nEc, Needs\nState of the art technology list\nPerfectly designed housing \nWith the goal to provide and take care of everything. The company is a non-prophet funded at start by a generous investor who shares the vision. \nCreate a team each with their own role. Start going for government funding. Have 20 architects work with ecologist and leading engineers from multiple companies. Design perfect buildings soundproof best and latest tech, smart fridge garbage chute in the wall. All residents have, all to basement where it is collected and sorted with ai in basement. Everything recycled properly. Make it green building.\nPitch: Everything company where everyone can have everything. Have you struggled with rent in the past and as a result worked with multiple jobs. Always focussed on work to pay the mortgage. To pay for food. Wanting to go to university for your dream job but worries of money to stop you. Do you find yourself in a cycle? And would you like to change it? What if you could live in a facility with the commodities of a home. Luxury of an apartment. And all services provided. Go down to the service desk sign out one of the vehicles or register for a training day out with someone who has devoted their worktime to teaching. \nEveryone in the community that lives here enters residency through a contract, some give us their mortgage some with no debt and positive in the bank when entering we will figure is the record all of this for your benefits and never in the negative format. We have in each building a cafeteria with food provided for meals, confirm on your fridge if you plan to come down. Cook in your own kitchen go down to the grocery store or anything you want you can buy with your residence card. Buying in this case refers to inventory management want something brought in for you, just requested. We provide everything and in return you work on yourself or with the community we have our own hospital that partners with Universities to provide the best education and care of patients, unlike current healthcare we aim to connect physiological dentistry imagery psychology and all other branches of healthcare. \nAll located within convenient locations around the Community less hours on healthcare workers. Broader percentage of people being helped as all of these are free. Less stress and demand as well as these people are your neighbour now. Why unless it was a rough day with patients or staff have hostility.\nPeople that like to garden can get their own little plot of land to do as they please and while they are at work. Gardeners who devote to it can tend to it.\nBusiness professions this illuminates the need for competition, example: competing over clients because now if you choose to live at our facility. We will outsource/work contract meaning we will go to your job and offered to partner with them to keep you on as an employee. Payroll is directed to me and you can just focus on the best for yourself the business and our company. If the employer agrees our job service department branches with them offering direct help and sometimes even funding to the business you work for to improve work conditions and quality of life for you and those around you, Regardless of if they are with the company or not. However if our job service department can’t come to an arrangement which should theoretically never happen. We would ask as in the contract that you resign and we find nearly any job in the open community or within the company that you will enjoy and be happy with. \n-\nUnifying healthcare with the workforce, and bringing everyone together as a team. Taking money out of the equation of society so it can perform properly and to the highest standard. I suggest an organization nonprofit called everything company that has designed utopia like facilities with state of the art features constantly growing and changing to fit our residencies needs. The company offers residency to above 95% of the population into those who we can’t provide for, we still to the best of our ability try to provide an offer services to those in need. We offer residency through a contract agreeing to work/school/help/etc. mechanics can work in their department part of the facility (multiple through each city) All vehicles we provide or looked at and worked on every day. Each resident can sign out a vehicle and take a trip anywhere. Go to the activity registration desk and sign up for lessons skydiving, and learn from someone who has made this a workday out of their passion. for Helping others experience the activity. Trying to do everything to find motivation or what interests you. Go to school for what you love no worries of that as long as in some form you work or help the organization and done with education. Have classmates and teacher who care about what they choose. Teens exiting high school shall receive their own apartment once of age with a special contract giving extra gap time to help each individual find their place in society. This special contract gives them time and choice to decide if the organization is right for them. If however you do choose to leave. We will help job searching/apartments hunting and whatever you choose. Hopefully the children that were born into the organization see we only try to benefit their growth and less towards resentment. Regardless they are given choices and awareness towards life. In the gap time we offer you to shadow/Trai jobs and to help save in case you choose to leave. \n-\nFixing plastic now that every service is free and residents no longer have to worry about money. We can direct the funds to finding immediate solutions to these problems well expanding. Otherwise it’s private companies hiding research process for profit even though an organization like this could create kelp/hemp/algae just has a few examples from start to while pushing public research for humanities problems\n-What to do with the world. Everything company. That’s the statistics starting with plastic waste how hot the earth is get all the stats of it.\nProblems currently in the world: extinction of millions of species, starvation/water. Waste. Oceans filled with plastic, low fish due to plastic. And yet plastic is still being produced trash equals no idea how to fix. Atmosphere car pollution everything else.\nWhy can’t the individual tackle these. They have to work to survive they have to focus on survival rather than growth of the south survival of the species.\nWhy doesn’t governments. \nSeparation/distraction/focuses on current survival of one rather than collective group of individuals. Did you know banks print digital money through an imaginary process of interest often with no purpose but survival and it is all designed to distract away from growth by adding fillers and forcing ideas etc. Orson needs and desires through advertising and marketing. Why do we work and would you work for free and doing what you love if you no longer had to worry about you and your families survival giving you time and resources to pursue passions and dreams\n—-\nWhat you need: Plans for housing units minimum 220' x220' being multiple stories (10-15-20 stories) with observation deck, public restrooms, cafeteria, separate building for services and access to psychological treatment or psycho therapy, housing units will need to be honestly - perfect units with multiple options. Single rooms doubles family special needs etc, in order to hopefully minimalize \"greed\".\nIn addition as the company expands after the foundation is set; hundreds of architects that work with the company, can work to design perfect buildings that meet everyone’s needs and desires, as well as interior decorating and all that\n\nTrash compactors, Recycling shoot, Garb orator, The absolute best shower and toilets. YOU have ONE chance at this don’t fuck it up cause people will be using this for years to come hopefully, no stress, low energy use, minimalize pollution, hopefully all trash is collected by garbage shoots having perhaps a separate for toxic etc? auto sort and have recycling solutions and trash collection in place, low flow toilets, windows that absorb energy as well as can perhaps be tinted to save the energy needed to cool building, fridge that has calendar connected to company and can tell you everything you can make and rough time of expire helping plan meals for the whole family or being able to check if you are confirming to be at the cafeteria tonight for dinner service breakfast lunch etc. So they have a rough estimate. Recollection of water? Auto filtration system, keep in mind I don't intend to do this for just the white world I want the same engineers contractors to be able to go around the world and build the same design perfectly, have storage into walls make space of everything. \nYou want a perfect design so that people will be comfortably living in them for their lives or until they are ready to move. No problems = Nothing to complain about\nConnect all services for easy access build a new design of roads able to absorb some amount of electricity even if its miniscule, is their ways to discharge it into vehicles driving on it, can you use the kinetic energy if no normal cars were on the road and reinvent roads to be like wall E, using magnetism to spin wheels and push car forward, water drainage, what happens if there is a problem with one segment of road, \n---\n100% of income earned goes to the compounds collective interest and/or reinvestment.\nuniversal basic income and allowances, you have a compound card to scan at the grocery store to track your purchases and make healthy suggestions meal suggestions all things in grocery store are plastic free solutions, the reason for cards is if we can track averages then we can find the right amount without waste etc, \n　\nPick an area to start, (for this concept I'm going to just keep it simple to myself).\nBuy as much land as you possibly can in said area\nHave a team of architects and engineers \n------------------------\nYou get a job where you feel fulfilled and enjoy it, with the goal being it is the job of your dreams, while having a free education, free apartment in the \"compound\" (foundation/the businesses/government run buildings where everything is provided) (Singapore) free groceries, free social services connections to counseling phsyio therapy rehabilitation centers, we have a care home where comfort is actually the priority, specialized connected community dealing with dementia and associated diseases. Where your doctors can walk over and check to see how they are doing and consistently monitor behaviours to ensure the best level of comfort and treatment.\nWe will keep you updated and aware of what is happening, with permission we also partner with universities and other companies that specialize in treatment and research of such diseases, in hopes of better understanding and growth in the field.\nPets are welcomed and encouraged in the community but only with/if proper rules are followed, being things like take it outside regularly clean up after it. Some people living in the compound are extremely passionate about animals some being dogs cats parrots etc, these people have jobs of coming around to your apartment on certain days (check smart calendar on your fridge to see what your days are like) your pet are signed up for , to spend a few hours out with them. They will look after your pets and clean up after them, spending time loving them and doing what makes them happy, some people take this as a side job not knowing yet what they enjoy and some hoping to be a veterinarian.\nWhere healthcare is connected and free. Dental, psychology, x-ray, clinicians, opticians, physicians, specialists, all working together for your betterment. \nDay care continuing into preschool and elementary all the way to university, if you so choose\nParents and adults can get help with a wide varieties of counselling, \nJob services puts you in touch with social workers that help you find something suited for you that you actually enjoy.\non site gym that also partners with health care as well and has physio etc\nCompound 400 ppl prebuilding\nBuilding requirements\n----------\nGovernment over control on all consumer products, packaging will be provided to companies for controlled price of overall medium, funds will be provided to accommodate monopolies.\nGovernment opens and partners with universities cannabis and environmental pipelines electric companies\nCreating facilities to manufacture bamboo, algae, hemp, and other possible solutions to decrease the amount of waste and pollution towards the planet, with university support and moderation combining all corporations into the betterment of mankind, we can have other support companies offer to work under depends on socio economic model in place.\nUniversities get very high funding teachers that work at universities partnered with company are able to join and live near campus, whether or not they want to is completely up to them, with students living on dorm or near with family up to them what they choose, all day cafeterias for living accommodations as well as university, rotation shifts to train and keep burn out to a minimum and get highest feed back for solutions placement improvements etc. Universities are now non profit people enjoy there classes or they can respectfully leave or transfer, if they have problems any student can access any service they request.\n-----------------------------------\nIntro My name is Kody and I believe the world isnt trying hard enough. \n2nd\nScary stats\nPlastic/waste\nEmissions\nAnimal Extinction/ Low Fish　\n　\n3rd\nBut as shitty as the world is maybe everyone can make it all better, i propose an organization, with goals of:\nHousing, Job services/placement, health care, education, waste management/control. Free services for your enjoyment. \nGoals of providing each person with a fuffiled life, engaged in what you choose.\nHelp us help you.\nBetterment of mankind, technological advancements, uniting the species and understanding our peace.\nEliminating the need for greed so someone can finally do something about the problems in the world.\n　\n4th\nWhy hasn't this beendone already, what will it take for a billionaire or a parent company or government. To step in and quickly fix the planet before it is to late, if its not to late already.\nI truly cant see any other step for humanity as a species than to work as a team. all the organisms in your body can do it, so why cant we ? \nA drop of bad water in the ocean doesn't need to ruin the whole ocean.\n　\nOutro\nAgain at the time of writing this am only an average normal twenty year old, with dreams of making the world better, yet little hope. But I literally gave the answers. A lifeguard can only help someone willing to be helped or he/she will drown as well.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nImagine all companies and studios having the choice to partner with organization and have increased resources while eliminating the required need for money, for workers to work, or consumers to enjoy it?\nPotentially getting : Disney, Sony, Netflix, \nMicrosoft, Google, Bing, \n　\nDisney and Sony can now have al consumers vote (if they choose) on polls to settle disputes and they can share a movie universe each providing towards the enjoyment of others rather than focusing on profits. And those who can only focus on profits will be phased out or forced to find other purpose in life.\nImagine if all these companies shared information under one roof. How fast would humanity improve? Buddy at google ends up coming up with 49% solution to the worlds problems for computers but has it patented, if only he can work with the other person at Microsoft with the counterpart 49%. Now that they can publicly share this the pubic ends up providing the last 2% and we are all the better for it?\n------------------------------------------　\nMillions of people majority of them being senior; Live in assisted living where __________--\n　\nPay up the ass and cant focus on entertaining/bettering themselves, but rather surviving pension paycheck to paycheck unable to truly do what they wish. Instead the organization provide as a larger more developed model.\nWhere people can socialize so much more, from 40 to 400 a building and a plethora of engage able activities.\nDementia care could be designed in a near city like enclosed area again connected to facility.\ncomplex care could be managed beside hospital units, large areas where workers get assistance they need, and enjoy coming to work to care and not be overworked. They can report any and all issues with promise of follow up, and continuum of choices for reporting issues.\nThe universities/science branches/ health care/research now can be added to everyday settings and have private care taken away, with focus being on individual self and mankind.\nAdding to everyday settings provides growth and opportunity to be shared and taught upon.\nAs a health care aide, I see medicines that do twenty things being used to treat one effect/result in a patient, It needs more accurate research.\nDoctors are overworked because they are understaffed because it isn't worth being trapped in debt over. If we take away these worries and everyone can work in a manner they like. Society should theoretically function properly.\n----------------------------------------------\n\"What to do with the world.\"\nEverything company\nstats \nproblems currently in the world: \nextinction of millions of species\nstarvation/ dying of thirst\nwaste\nocean filled with plastic low fish plastic is still being produced \ntrash = no idea how to fix? bullshit its uniting so we can actually do algae farms, mass collection of waste, sorting and reusing materials, \natmosphere, car pollution\nand everything else.\n　\n- Why cant the individual tackle these. We work so we can survive in this day and age, we focus so much on our momentary survival. Rather than growth of self and our future, or the survival of the species. Care for the earth, what impact does each of our actions have on everything around us.\n- Why doesn't government do something to help the people so they aren't stuck in a cycle of survival. Instead the focus is on separation of the people, distraction, focusses on current survival of one rather than collective group or individuals.\nDid you know banks have technically printed more money than any other government, although its not physical money quite like what we were used to, the gold standard per dollar. But rather through \"debt\" a fairly new concept in terms of banking especially when going passed the government to add additional value to that being borrowed, creating and endless cycle of only 100billion cash circulation, 20 trillion in all digital platforms of banks, and then the debt adds that rack up to 40 trillion being owed. No matter how people try to pay it back, inevitably their only option is to be defensive, countries lead to war over this, tensions over china. 20tril owed to them, yet they don't ask for it back.\nThe whole political system is all designed to distract away from these things, it forces us to be cogs in a machine and not really make an impact unless we stop working. Where as I see a new system of growth and betterment of mankind, uniting countries over time. Endless possibilities.\nForcing the idea of \"needs\" upon people in society. Having to work for needs is wrong in so many regards. Should a king not provide for his people? Why do we work? And would you work for free doing what you love? If you no longer had to worry about you and your families survival, what would you seek in life.\nGiving you time and resources to peruse passions and dreams; while unifying healthcare with workforce and bringing everyone together as a team. Taking money out of the equation or keeping a universal basic income regardless it can all be sorted after.\nI suggest an organization non profit called everything company tat has designed utopia like facilities wit state of the art features, constantly growing and changing to fit our residencies needs.\nThe company offers residency to above 95% of population. And to those we cant provide for, we still offer services as best as we can.\nE C: offers residency through a contract; agreeing to work/school/bettering yourself/getting help/treatment/care of others/ etc.\n-\nFixing plastic, now that every service is free and residents no longer have to worry about money and budgeting, we can direct funds to finding immediate and temporary solutions to these epidemics that fill the world today, while expanding globally to assist everyone in the world that is willing. Otherwise its private companies hiding research for profit even to an organization like this could create kelp/hemp/algae farms to start while pushing public research for humanities problems.\n　\nMechanics can work in their department (section/ part of the facility).All vehicles we provide are looked at and worked on everyday. Each resident can sign out a vehicle and take a trip anywhere they choose, as if they were in their own home. With the added benefit of optional automatic driving, everyday maintenance, a car suited to whatever activity (almost) always available.\nGo to activity registration desk and sign up for lessons skydiving, and learn from someone who has made this a work day out of their passion for the activity and helping others experience it. Try and do everything to find motivation or what interest you.\nGo to school for what you love. No worries of debt as long as in some form you work or help the organization when done with education. Have classmates and teachers who care about what they are in. Focusing on self growth rather than gain.\n　\nTeens exiting high school shall receive their own apt once of age with (three different options) a special contract giving gap time to help each individual find their place in society.

Millions of people trek to Broadway in NYC or the Louvre just to witness art. Travelling art to the people enables more people to witness the arts and also diminishes the need for many more people to make long, polluting trips to our arts centres. \n\nThat said, there is waste in these endeavours. Trucking is problematic, but compared to the transport of millions of people, less of a problem. Lighting uses electricity, but the cheap 1,000 watt PAR bulbs we've had for the past half century have started going the way of the dodo about 15 years ago. They have been replaced by $1,000 colour-mixing LED fixtures that use only 90 watts. We've replaced 120,000 watts of consumption with 1,060 watts worth of smart fixtures on a typical show.\n\nAt the end of a gig, our bins are empty.\n\nIf you want to look at where the real waste happens, take a look at the food service industries that surround festivals. Plastic cups and paper plates. Uneaten food and spilled beverages tossed anywhere. (In fact, the worst job in my business is the person who has to clean all of the gunk off of the Front of House cable runs. Hope for no vomit.)",

As it is, funding vast amounts of climate change emissions in order to be entertained is not environmentally aware.\n\nIt’s great that they haven’t used plastic bottles, but it’s not nearly enough for the situation we’re in.

Regardless I'm sure there are a fair few people who don't care all that much, but having an institution like Glastonbury force them to not use single use bottles is a positive thing.\n\nWhat is it about my point that makes you think I believe not using single use plastic bottles is all that is needed? I never implied it was job done and we should all pat ourselves on the backs. I was just saying it's a good thing that proves a point that we can go on our daily lives without using plastic bottles. By extension of that we should be able to phase out many other forms of plastic.\n\nIt's just a cynical approach to basically devalue people's actions because they think it's cool. If someone does something positive whether that's through genuine care for the environment or because they think it's cool to be socially responsible then why does it matter? They still did something positive. \n\nIt seems you just have a bit of a cynical view on things \"Just so people can dance around to international artists and get wasted\" is quite belittling of something that can be hugely important to people. Getting together and celebrating music arts and culture with other people is generally a pretty beneficial thing. Whilst j definitely agree the music industry could do more to cut pollution, it is hardly the biggest culprit and it also has a valuable place in society. I would be very upset if festivals stopped happening because of this. Also surely it is better to fly 1000 artists in for a festival then cancel it and have 75,000 people fly to a different country. \n\nI never said we were winning any wars or that we should rest on our laurels, I just think that the world's largest music festival going bottle free is a good step in the right direction. Having an extremely well respected and well-knoen documentation making comments about this which will get shared around the world is a good thing.",

As that actually achieves the aim of seriously reducing climate change emissions.\n\nObviously, I don’t think they should do exceptional feats of environmental action. They don’t have to, just stop funding a massively polluting industry, that gets a bye because it entertains you. Reduce. Reduce. Reduce.\n\nIt’s not my expectations that are in question, it’s the reality that we are close to the edge, and we need to reduce polluting industries activity. Even if they have a lovely public face, and seem to be too exciting to ignore.\n\n> So when people say that we just get distracted and go on to the next trend can seriously go fuck themselves. \n\nYou’re saying that about a festival that is fundamentally about seeing the next trend, and that is massively oversubscribed for tickets every year.\n\nIt isn’t either/or, we all need to reduce our consumption. \n\nYou’re demonstrating how effectively the media has got you blaming others so you don’t have to think about your own behaviour. They’ve given you a bye for why you don’t have to feel bad about indulging yourself, because you’re not as bad as the other side. Divide and rule. Look at who in the media is talking most about this generational divide - it’s the Mail, Times, and Telegraph.\n\n> Actually talk to any of those people and they will not only be aware of the dangers and impacts of climate change, but they'll more likely than not be doing their small part in trying to help. Whether that be reducing meat consumption, using reusable bottles, etc.\n\nOf course I’ve spoken to those people, as I said before. And yes, some of them have cut their meat intake, and some use reusable bottles etc. But all of them fly off for weekend breaks, blowing all those savings by creating vastly more emissions than they can save in one go, and funding and encouraging very polluting tourism industries.\n\nI mean, look how outraged you are by someone pointing out that not flying, or buying tickets to fund people to be flown in to entertain you, is what actually reduces your climate footprint in the way that you say you feel proud of. I’m not snatching your happiness unfairly from you, I’m not being carried away by the first baby steps being taken 20 years too late.\n\nIt’s not like I’ve just started pointing this out, you know. Your response sounds just like what people were saying 20 years ago, much as you seem to think you’re so different from them.\n\nIf we’d done what was needed 20 years ago, we wouldn’t need to cut back so hard now. If we don’t cut back hard now, it will be much, much worse in the future. You’re condemning the next generation to terrible misery if you don’t just stop buying from industries that always have a reason why their climate change emissions don’t count.\n\nWe don’t have time for greenwashing anymore. Of course Glastonbury isn’t the worst for this, but it’s big enough, and demonstrates to its crowd how they can greenwash, that it needs to be brought down to Earth. Otherwise, we are fucked, because that kind of entertainment business can’t exist in a climate neutral society.\n\nI mean, tell me how it can, rather than finding reasons why it’s unfair to say that.",

Some personal notes: this shit is seriously disgusting. It's really enraging how little it takes to buy someone off to help destroy the world. Of the 131 politicians from the article, there were only five I couldn’t find financial conflicts with. That’s 96% of these people, upon even the most cursory of glances, that have been proven to prioritize money over the health of the Earth. I can’t stress this enough: Fuck. Them.\n\nI left off airline companies and (for the most part) chemical companies who produce plastics. I don't know why I did this and I'm not gonna go back and change it now. But if you're clicking through the links, keep that in mind, too. \n\nI've only used the one source, but OpenSecrets is widely used by reputable sources to find campaign contribution information. They are quite transparent with their methodology on their site. \n\nAll those repeat companies are absolutely not a coincidence. These are the types of conspiracy theories that people should be worried about. \n\nI just went with obvious companies who stand to lose something from government intervention to combat climate change. I definitely didn't look up every company that was on a rep's page. If you find additional things you think I should add, let me know.\n\nIf you catch any errors I've made or think I need to take off certain companies, let me know and we can talk about it. \n\nAgain, thanks for reading. And fucking VOTE.",

This project is designed to increase our level of self-awareness regarding our levels of consumption and waste. \n\nMy artistic research has been led by the idea that beauty, though often hard to see, is everywhere. I began by recontextualising waste objects as art objects, however this project has evolved to sit within a broader context. \n\nIn order to make my research as effective as possible, I’d like as many of you to complete this survey as you can. It’s 10 short questions- most of which are multiple choice. IF the link doesn’t work please copy and paste it into your browser.\n\n[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SWHWRD5](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SWHWRD5)\n\nThere is an opportunity to receive my information pack, ‘A Little Honest Guide to Plastic’ for free. This will be in a digital format to prevent unnecessary waste.

We have evidence! \n\n\nwe are a scientists co: turned alternative experimenters! (Trying youtube)\n\n *People* *with* *A* *Brain* *Read* !!! ⤵\n\nWe are from the united kingdom & we are here to spread some light upon secret science GOD & SCIENCE are ONE? Either way we need to spread awarness NOW not later or tomorrow NOW. together us! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n⤵\nTheres secrets in Sacred geometry,frequency and vibration! https://youtu.be/SY5SmzqUeyY real life magic😨yes REAL! **Modern music & TV is poisening our childrens minds! Manipulation is at play.billionaires run the world! Its happening rite now!, and here's how (and no not the plastic war killing our beautiful sea life thats another topic) \n\n\n\n⤵\nthe world is at a critical point in time .nature is 100% Stressed, Mankind is disorganized! we need to join and spread our points & discover the TRUTH as a collective ASAP! Instead of watching mainstream science and news! And cat videos ! We're born grow have kids raise them die? Is that all is to life? (Again another topic) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n⤵\nlets take a closer look at natural disasters thats taking place all over the world rite NOW! Earth, natural and very unnatural. ⤵\n\n\nIn my early years we started researching by \npercentages and how they increase over a period of time,  increasing at a intense speed. Earth changes whether it's Grand solar minimum,⤵\n\n droughts related to forest fires, solar flares, earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, increasing flooding around the world, potential magnetic reversal, enormous cracks and sinkholes, developing from the earth expanding and heating up from inside the Earth's core. What more signs does this civilization needs from ⤵\n\n\nGod or alien, (whatever you may believe)⤵\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n If you take the time to research you will find out that there is a number of military exercises that took place in 2018. ⤵\n\n\n\n\nThe government is preparing for martial law. We have a increase in earthquakes 500% since 2012. In 2012, we began to research the percentage of volcanoes at that time. It was 30 volcanoes that year. Last year 2018 we had 40 volcanoes eruptions.⤵\n\n\n By the end of this year 2019 we will see 45 to 50 The increase of earthquakes throughout our planet has increased from 2012 through 2017 was 300% and 200% in 2018 a total of 500%. Also a 500% increase in meteors, ⤵\n\neach day at least 8 to 10 and at night 8 to10. That's 16 to 20 in a 24 hour period. Increasing in droughts 40% and 300% increase in forest fire since 2016. 200% in 2018 alone. ⤵\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of regular amount of rain fall. The cloud formations are dumping billions of gallons in a 24 HRS. Resulting in a staggering 40% increase in worldwide flooding.& if that is not enough, large enormous cracks throughout the continents to throughout the world. A 40% increase in sinkholes.100% increase in landslides⤵\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n. From reliable sources we have much to share! What you hear on the the television or read on the internet, is nothing more than programming. ⤵\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarth's core heating? Outside force? human Agenda? Angry earth? God? Spiritual? Natural? every planet in our solar system seems to display sighns!\n⤵\n\n\n\n\n\n .Researchers are stating that the loud booms that are being heard around the world, is the result of the Earth's crust separating from the mantle? If this continues and reaches 60% we will go through a magnetic reversal? ⤵\n\nThe flashes of light is the result of static electricity when the pressure is released. The problem is, there is not enough data and information dealing with the history of a magnetic reversal and of the Earth's crust separating from the mantle or poleShift ⤵\n\n\n.If you look at the current events such as Fukushima which has been dumping 300 to 500 tons of nuclear waste since 2011. In the month of August 2018 dumped 920,000 tons of nuclear waste in the Pacific Ocean, because there is no longer room for the storage tanks to hold the nuclear waste. Just December 2nd 2018 147 whales Beach themselves in New Zealand and now the Dolphins are coming up dead on Florida's Coast.⤵\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In the past year Chile, Argentina and New Zealand combined hundreds of whales and thousands of dolphins Beach themselves. It's all about greed Corporation and Corruption, is it not ? When a civilization has reached a peak or point that the planet can no longer produce or sustain life for the civilization. ⤵\n\n\nThe balance of negative and positive energy. The scale towards negativity is increasing at a normous rate, adjustments will be made. For example. Today 285,000 children was abandoned and 180,000 will end up in human trafficking. Children in Danger, santanic rituals, sacrifices and child enslavement. Death before born? Planned Parenthood? evil civilization? Is The sale of children Souls a commodity? pure evilness? ⤵\n\nThe continuation of persecution of certain religeons in modern times are increasing. Also today 135,000 people died of starvation and dehydration and none of this is on the news⤵\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf that is not enough, China is building a super Collider, twice as big as the one in Switzerland. And CERN announce they are going to build another one ten times as big as the original ! .Basically CERN is determined to remove The Great Veil if you will?⤵\n\n its 100%, a high science technology interdementional computer! Either for travel or Aliens ?i dont believe its a good thing for sure! but for sure the billionaires are involved with the outcome!.The Illuminati is determined to activate it in the timeline that we are living in. To open it up and expose this planet to the darkness that has never been seen upon the face of the Earth.or so they believe! ⤵\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso leading the way on 5G! The dangers are real. DNA single and double strand breaks, oxidative damage, disruption of cell metabolised increased blood brain barrier ⤵\n\npermeability, melatonin reduction, disruption to brain glucose metabolism, generation of stress proteins. Let’s not also forget that in 2011 the World Health Organization (WHO) classified radio frequency radiation as a possible 2B carcinogen. The list goes on and on. Artificial intelligence, RFID CHIPS and Transhumanism is here⤵\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n. RFID CHIPS is set up on the barcode system if you research Lucent Technologies. In which their logo is the snake chasing its tail which is a ancient symbol for Lucifer the company is owned by AT&T we deliver the world slogan.⤵\n\n\n Recently, it was announced that AT&T split into 3,One of Laboratory's , has been fresly renamed Lucent Technologies, Lucent's software. Their, formal Main office for years was 666 5th Avenue New York New York the building was owned by The Rockefellers, but recently purchased by Donald Trump's son in law. ⤵\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chip is based on the monetary system and in which will scan the chip that will be implanted between your right thumb and your index finger. They finally completed the technology in which the chip also has a GPS! If the RFID chip is removed once it receives oxygen the monetary system is shut off but the GPS will continue to operate!⤵\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The great & fearsome Solar Serpent who is pictured biting his own tail in a circle? Lucent's logo The fiery, red sun, or circle, is his image.How Strange that the logo for Lucent Technologies is a red circle?⤵\n\n\n\nModern day New Age and Freemasonry groups continue this ancient glorification of Lucifer? 1 prominent New Age organization is the Lucis Trust'. Its founder, Alice Bailey, hailed the horned 1 as \"bringer of light,\" the \"shining one.\" he is, she trumpeted, the \"Illuminator of mankind. Since Bailey's global occult group, the Lucis Trust, reveres Lucifer and the Illuminator of mankind & also promotes Freemasonry,Illuminati with its Egyptian religion& many more cults?⤵\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalso believe that the event of the timelines was already known long before the universe was ever created by God or Alien .our civilization that has no direction and no definition of themselves, because we are lost in our own false reality? Failed civilisation? ⤵\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWE DO A NEW TOPIC EVERY MONTH we inspect it to the best of our abilities, we are More for spreading the INFORMATION ! & videos are just for attention to the unknowing public .LATEST NEWS ⤵\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou drink water with a memory! Try to drink as clean water as possible.The true nature of water, which is the source of life .is unknown. We still know very little about the fascinating properties of water and its secrets.⤵\n\n\n\n\n\nWater hides a lot of power that we are able to release and shape with the help of the energy of our strong emotions, both positive and negative.Life as we know it is entirely dependent upon water to survive.yet most of us take this precious liquid for granted. We drink what comes out of the faucet or in bottle form from the gas station without a second thought, and it is not our fault because we are physically incapable of detecting the difference between good & bad water. ⤵\n\n\n\nSure it might be pure and have added minerals, but scientists are now discovering most human drinking water is considered to be dead, void of any energy.Crazy as that sounds, that is only the beginning of what they are discovering about water’s capabilities.⤵\n\n\n\nA Russian scientist by the name of Dr. Konstantin Korotkov has developed an instrument that can determine the energetics of water. Anything that enters a strong electromagnetic field begins to emit light Greater the energy, the brighter the light.He found that ordinary drinking water contained little if any, energy. H2o with no human contact was shown to be 40,000 times more energetically active & its crystalline structure near to Perfection.* *⤵\n\n\nIf you are reading this post and agree or part agee with it.

        "text": "The recycling program is revealed for the fraud it is. All our plastic is spreading throughout the food chain. I've even heard said there's micro-plastics lodged in our brains. \n\nMost Euro/American men will be sterile by 2050. Euro/Americans are more feminized than Africa and Asia. We are dulled depressed and sickened by our own air water and food.\n\nThere are maybe a billion Euro/Americans, so maybe 5 billion African/Asians. They are more young virile and male due to limited multiple exposures so far. China is building massive infrastructure to serve these markets, and those young billions will not be socialist during the boom phase. \n\nWe can't flood the world with sex robots and drones. We are not going to live on Mars and big fast EVs won't change anything. After 30 years of trying, solar and wind are only 1-3% of the world's total energy use. \n\nWe have to destroy demand within 10 years. When people say we got 10 years to fix the climate, it doesn't mean we got until the last day of the 9th year. \n\nIt is not only PFAS feminizing species, it's the combination of petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and wifi in the air water food.\n\nEvery toy drone is made of plastic and trace metals. Every fitbit is killing the earth. Urban classrooms can be 1,000 ppm CO2 and filled with off gassing PFAS that are also found in drinking water. Herbicides rot your gut and pesticides make males infertile and mentally ill. Dow gave us this with their non-stick, stain-free, fire-proof, waterproof clothes and furniture because cigarettes kept burning down houses back in the day when everyone smoked.\n\nVideo time turns kids myopic, rewires their brain and causes them to become addicted to ideological fantasies. The pollution in urban air is like smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, and makes us stupider. Urban classroom air at 1,000 ppm CO2 makes kids 15% stupider. Kids drink juice and water are filled with toxic metals, which make them stupider. Imagine how smart our kids would be without all this. Of course if affect poor blacks more than rich whites, but that's not what matters anymore, because its spreading to the rest of the world, and they're all the same race.\n\nWifi is a brand new experiment the human race can't give up. The 5G rollout will be like sticking our testicles and heads in a microwave. \n\n5G IOT AI WIFI is why China is buying up oil, instead of burning oil in cars, we can now turn oil into ipads and phones. Petrochemical demand is growing 7X faster than population growth. \n\nBy assigning fake safe limits to everything we've ignored how much of everything there is everywhere, and their cumulative power over our evolutionary destiny. We can't escape our race sex class or even geography, but we can tax the rich without the government. Here's how...\n\nI am a delusional optimist because I believe 100% private carbon taxes on the rich can fix avarice. By taxing the rich we can sublimate deep state surveillance/targeting AI into a universal basic income worldwide. Taxing the rich with 100% private carbon taxes means 100% of it goes back to the poor, no middle man. \n\nWe have the computing power to keep track of every dollar on earth. This means we can eliminate tax havens, if we transition from oil security dollars to a world basic income. World socialism will take decades, we can tax greed in just a few years.\n\nI am not educated, so if you are, then spread this topic, but don't expect any success, and lots of blowback. I know because denial is something I'm good at.\n\nLinks:\n\n135 peer-reviewed scientific studies & reports showing effects of EMF exposures on male fertility (1972-2012)\n\nhttp://www.emfresearch.com/emfs-male-fertility/\n\nPFAS = male infertility + smaller penises \n\nhttp://www.michiganradio.org/post/pfas-chemicals-can-potentially-cause-male-infertility-and-smaller-penis-size\n\nPFAS = Most western men will be infertile by 2060\n\nhttps://www.indy100.com/article/men-infertile-2060-science-us-europe-australia-new-zealand-8025861\n\nPFAS = Forever Chemicals in Drinking Water\n\nhttps://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/epa-blasted-failing-set-drinking-water-limits-forever-chemicals\n\nDental flossing and other behaviors linked with higher levels of PFAS in the body\n\nhttps://silentspring.org/research-update/dental-flossing-and-other-behaviors-linked-higher-levels-pfas-body\n\nPFAS in Drinking Water: Hazardous at Ever-Lower Levels\n\nhttps://www.ewg.org/news-and-analysis/2019/02/pfas-drinking-water-hazardous-ever-lower-levels\n\nPFAS: Insights from Past Actions to Inform Today’s Decisions\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41370-018-0113-2\n\nChina will become the dominant user of petrochemicals.\n\nI don't believe PFAS, pesticide, herbicide and pharmacide regulation is high on their list of priorities. Only by taxing the rich can prevent psychotic behavior.\n\nDo you know that 3.5 billion people fly each year? That's half the people on earth. Corporations NGOs and governments have been fighting climate change for 30 years, and emissions went up 60% in 30 years. Socialism and capitalism have been at odds for 100 years. It will take 50 years for socialism to spread worldwide if we don't shut down tax havens for the rich. You can't put the cart before the horse.\n\nMale Feminization Affects All Vertebrates: \n---\n\nThis next link is important because species feminization has been found in even remote wilderness areas. There's also a link about how pesticides can make humans depressed and males infertile.\n\nThis all happened because academia sold out to big business 100 years ago. Be sure to check out the Academic Fraud section. You heard of fake news, will wait til you hear about fake science.\n\nhttps://lokisrevengeblog.wordpress.com/2018/12/29/unfinished-business/\n\nEcological Policy Failure = Humanity’s Greatest Mistake\n\nhttps://lokisrevengeblog.wordpress.com/2019/03/04/ecological-policy-failure-humanitys-greatest-mistake/\n\nI saved the scariest for last\n--- \n\nThiamine deficiency is affecting life at the top of the seafood chain including seabirds etc., and scientists don't know which pollutants are the cause, which also means there are other likely causes. \n\nResearchers also flagged increasing evidence of thiamine deficiencies in a range of taxonomic groups and in ocean waters as a possible driver of wildlife declines. This is especially worrisome how it affects plankton. We can't figure out if its pollutants or climate change or both.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6196476/",

        "text": "By: [**Ashley Curtin**](https://www.nationofchange.org/author/acurtin/) / [NationofChange](https://www.nationofchange.org/2019/03/15/seaweed-straws-could-soon-replace-single-use-plastic-straws/#) / News Report -\n\n**Read the article here:** [https://www.nationofchange.org/2019/03/15/seaweed-straws-could-soon-replace-single-use-plastic-straws/](https://www.nationofchange.org/2019/03/15/seaweed-straws-could-soon-replace-single-use-plastic-straws/)\n\nIn an effort to phase-out single-use plastic straws and curb the effects that plastics have on climate change, one company came up with an environmentally friendly alternative to plastic straws. The startup company, Loliware, recently developed a straw made from seaweed.\n\nIn a Kickstarter-funded project, the company made “the gluten-free, non-GMO, sugar-free marine degradable straws” that “can withstand 18 hours of continuous use,” EcoWatch reported. The project has exceeded its initial goal by more than $20,000 and has close to 1,100 supporters.\n\n“Every piece of plastic ever created still exists,” Chelsea Briganti, CEO of Loliware, said in a statement. “There are five trillion pieces of plastic in our oceans; an estimated ten million tons of plastic is produced every second. Single use plastics should never be built to last, they should be designed to disappear.”\n\nThe sustainable seaweed straws “is a regenerative resource capable of sequestering carbon dioxide in an effort to curb the effects of climate change, the developers said in a statement. The straws have a shelf life of 24 months, take 60 days or less to break down – the same as food waste – and are edible.\n\nLoliware’s goal as a company is to replace single-use plastic straws with their seaweed straws at “high-waste venues like stadiums and fast-food restaurants,” EcoWatch reported.\n\nWhile pressure continues to mount for the elimination of single-use plastic, many companies have switched to paper straws as an alternative, “which cost three times as much to produce as their plastic counterparts and require tree-based resources,” EcoWatch reported.\n\nLoliware’s “hyper-compostable” seaweed straws look and feel just like plastic straws and could soon be in a drink near you.\n\nLoliware’s seaweed straws have exceeded their $30,000 goal by nearly $20,000 between almost 1,100 backers.",

        "text": "[I just saw this new video by greenpeace netherlands.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl37_PRd99A&list=LLvGYsiy0mwFK0Qb61LOD12w&index=2&t=3s) As far as I've understood, the issue with plastic is tree fold: \n\n* It is not a renewable resource, so we shouldn't rely on using it forever. After all it apparently can only be recycled 7 times.\n\n*  In order to get more we need to refine oil, which produces climate gases, which is a problem. \n\n*  All trash can randomly end up in nature instead of in the correct recycling bin, as accidents happen. As opposed to other things, plastic would need hundreds of years to decompose. So as opposed to throwing an apple on the ground, which is practically problem free, plastic would get torn into harmful micro plastics and get spread into the nature and ocean. \n\nAnd this last point is what I've understood is the most important (plastic production isn't exactly the main driving force being climate change). So in order to continue to use plastic we need to make sure we dispose of all of it by recycling or burning. Sadly we cant be sure of that allways happening, but if we were, it would be practically problem free. \n\nOfcourse it would be great to wait for scientists to create something similar to plastic that is degradable, but while that is yet to happen we need to limit plastic escaping into nature. Plastic still plays a huge role in eg. trash bags, which isnt that easy to replace with other things. What I believe is the biggest sources of plastic in nature is: \n\n1.  Things are hard to dispose of correctly, like gum, shotgun shells, teabags, cigarettes, glitter and some clothing (washing fleece releases some plastic?). The way to deal with this could be to consider banning the products that are too hard to dispose of correctly. \n\n2.  People in the western world randomly dropping a plastic bag or bottle, or buying too many plastic bags, creating a slightly larger market for plastic than it could be?\n\n3. [The poor people around in asia that throw their trash the only way they know how. ](https://news.sky.com/story/just-10-rivers-carry-90-of-plastic-polluting-the-oceans-11167581).\n\nHoping for these asian countries to get out of poverty enough to get a functioning system for recycling or burning their trash, or trying to gather up the trash running out of their rivers would help a lot. We can probably all agree on that the third point is the worst, but do you honestly think the second point is a bigger protblem for the environment than the first? Why is there not more focus on point 1? Buying plastic bags is potentially problem free after all, while glitter is in no way shape or form problem free. \n\nI allways thought that point 1 here was a much bigger problem than point 2. Better recycling and less of a culture for littering seems like a no brainer, and that could solve the second point. Products like my shoes for instance seem to be made with some plastic in eg. the soles that allways erode away into nature, and when Im done with them I cant exactly separate the plastic from the rest. Shouldn't this be talked about?\n",

Multiply this by the number of passengers and then by the number of daily flights and you get crazy amounts of single use plastic discarded daily...\n\nProps to this airline for making a step in the right direction. However I'm afraid producing single use forks and spoons made from bamboo is not sustainable either, how much bamboo do you need to cut and process if all airlines do the same??\nNot only we need these be bamboo, but also reusable I think.

Earth's changing climate will likely lead to massive disruptions in agriculture and food distribution networks. This will starve millions of people in a series of famines this century. It'll also exacerbate conflict, indirectly leading to many war deaths (Syrian civil war is arguably a result of drought made more likely by climate change). Also, precipitation patterns will change, coastlines will retreat, etc etc, which will force mass migrations by poor, brown people. Those refugees will likely be rejected by increasingly nationalist first world states, which will lead to further conflict and death. In the worst case scenario (which we seem to be tracking closely), hundreds of millions could die. The reason they'll be dying is present short term economic benefit and convenience for rich, first world countries, making this situation closely analogous to that faced by people who lived in a nation founded on the institution of chattel slavery. Poor brown people being murdered for the benefit of rich white people. The big difference is that climate change will, in the long run, hurt literally every human being. How am I measuring misery?? Death, starvation, thirst, war, general strife, etc.; you know, the usual metrics. And all this is entirely ignoring the mass extinction we're causing via land use and exacerbating by changing the climate, which vastly magnifies the moral indefensibility of continuing to burn carbon.

A company, **One Brush, One Tree strives to turn the routine purchase of buying a toothbrush into a movement to create a BIG, positive change on our Planet**. \n\nNot everyone has the time or money to promote environmental sustainability, this company takes it into their own hands by donating funds to a non-profit organization to **plant a tree for every toothbrush sold**.

While your plastic toothbrush is taking hundreds of years to decompose. The average American will throw use 300 toothbrushes in their lifetime!

The cleanest font in the world can now be used as a reminder that every piece of trash can be RECYCLED AND REUSED – even as art. It is also vectorized so anyone can leave or type a message in a font made from real garbage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/9ih4hq/video/fwxjo3seb6o11/player\n\n**The font**: includes all the letters of the Slovenian alphabet and was made by numerous volunteers from around the country when they finished with cleaning.

Slovenia wanted to go a step further and leave a special message to its residents and the whole world that would remind people that garbage doesn’t belong in the greens of a nature.\n\n“*We want to encourage people to learn and understand the importance of the right behavior towards nature and proper waste management. That´s why we were extremely happy that we were able to create something memorable from trash together with hundreds of volunteers collecting it. Now we can finally write and send a clean message to the world as there are more appropriate places for trash than nature”* stated Urša Zgojznik, The Ecologist without borders president.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredits\n\n**Ecologists without borders**\n\nEcologists without Borders is a non-profit founded in 2009 and one of the leading Slovenian NGOs dedicated to improving the state of our environment — focusing on efficient resource use and active citizenship.Most of its activities deal with waste at its source, but not all are limited to Slovenia.

        "text": "I've seen a lot of negativity on Reddit when it comes to enviromental issues, and while the cause for concern is real, the hopelessness is not only not entirely based in reality, but counterproductive. According to experts, the [extinction risk from climate change is between 9-19% over the next hundred years](http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.html). That's unacceptably high, but it's far from too high to give up. If we want to stay below 2 ºC warming, for example, we need a carbon price of [$20/tonne by 2020, $100/tonne by 2030, and $140/tonne by 2040, and enough political will to overcome the natural gas industry](https://www.nature.com/news/natural-gas-stands-to-get-a-boost-from-carbon-tax-1.17705). If we really care about environmental problems, there are plenty of effective actions we can (and should) take:\n\n* [**We need to vote**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U). It may sounds trite (or cynical) but whether or not you vote is a matter of public record, and if [EVP can write an algorithm with 89% accuracy to figure out if you care about the environment/climate change](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sites/default/files/2017-impact-report.pdf), then so can politicians, and politicians only care about their voting bloc, so if you don't vote, you and your values can safely be ignored by those in power. [Stinnett argues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U) (rather persuasively, imho) that the reason climate change didn't end up in the last debates is because of the anemic turnout among environmentalists. If we want politicians to care about the environment, we need to show them that it's worth their while.  I've personally donated over $100 to [EVP](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/) because it turns out [it's really cheap to turn out environmental voters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U)), and EVP currently only has enough funds to operate in 6 U.S. states. We tend to [grossly underestimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance#Examples) how much the rest of the public agrees with us on this stuff, but the truth is, [the number of people who say climate change is extremely important to them, personally, is at an all-time high](https://earth.stanford.edu/news/public-support-climate-policy-remains-strong).  So let's not squander this opportunity. With [~15 million superenvironmentalists across the U.S. not voting](https://thinkprogress.org/15-million-super-environmentalists-dont-vote-in-the-midterms/), we could truly be a force to be reckoned with and make demands of those in power if only we showed up. If you have money to [donate](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/donate), please do. If you don't, you could probably be at least as effective by [volunteering](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/get-involved). If you don't have time to volunteer, please at least [sign the pledge](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sign-the-pledge) to get reminders about upcoming elections in your local area, and maybe share your committment on social media or invite some friends to join you.\n\n* Maybe you have a hard time mustering the will to vote because none of the candidates fit your ideals perfectly (if you really despise them all equally, at least vote for a write-in so you still show up as a voter). Either way, there's a really good chance that whoever wins will not be perfect. So **what we need to do is lobby**. [Lobbying works](https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/friends_or_foes-how_social_movement_allies_affect_the_passage_of_legislation_in_the_u._s._congress.pdf), and [you don't need a lot of money to do it](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41759323?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) -- though it *does* help to [know effective tactics](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf) (hint: [write, call, and visit *your* member of Congress](https://twitter.com/editoremilye/status/797243415922515970?lang=en)). Even those members of Congress who seem hopeless [can make a change for the better with the right approach](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/lobbying/creating-champions-in-congress-and-in-the-media/). [Climate change is arguably one of the most pressing issues](https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/) facing humanity today. If we want to stay below 1.5 ºC warming (a [wise choice, and still possible](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-report-exclusive/exclusive-warming-set-to-exceed-1-5c-slow-economic-growth-u-n-draft-idUSKBN1JA1HD)) we will need to get off fossil fuels, which means [we will need a carbon tax](http://news.mit.edu/2016/carbon-tax-stop-using-fossil-fuels-0224), which is expected to [spur innovation](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2f60/cbfc3dcf2538140bbf07f43cf7038b8af8c8.pdf) while also [reducing emissions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy). If you're interested in free training in how to lobby Congress/Parliament, [Citizens' Climate Lobby](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/) offers free training to anyone in the world (though if you live in Kuwait, you may have to start your own chapter) in how to lobby for [Carbon Fee & Dividend](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/basics-carbon-fee-dividend/), a policy supported by [scientists](http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199856978.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199856978-e-026) and [economists](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.381.484&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

The policy would also likely reduce plastic waste, since plastics are made with fossil fuels, and fossil fuels would be more expensive under the policy. It [may come as a surprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance#Examples), but a majority of Americans in [each political party](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf) and [every Congressional district](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2018/) supports a carbon tax. CCL is maybe ~45k volunteers from passing CF&D in the U.S., but that's peanuts when you consider that [10% of Americans (that's tens of *millions*) would 'definitely' be willing to join a campaign to convince elected officials to mitigate climate](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf). [30% of Americans](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-May-2017.pdf) would be willing to join such a campaign if someone they like and respected asked them to, so bring a friend or two. I've personally donated thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours to CCL (and recruited more than a couple friends) because I think what they're doing is so important. If you can devote about an hour a week to lobby for a liveable planet, [sign up here](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/) for the free training. If you don't have time to train as a lobbyist, please at least sign up for free [text alerts](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/text/) so you can join coordinated call-in days. \n\n* I know there's a climate march coming up [this Saturday](https://peoplesclimate.org/), but while [protests can be effective at raising awareness](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/stop_raising_awareness_already), we are well [beyond](http://www.climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Six-Americas-2018-Mar.png) the point of awareness being a barrier to climate change, and [protests are not effective at passing legislation](https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/friends_or_foes-how_social_movement_allies_affect_the_passage_of_legislation_in_the_u._s._congress.pdf), for [reasons that will be obvious](https://www.ttbook.org/interview/barney-frank-why-protests-dont-work). **We** [**need to graduate to effective tactics**](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/21/is-there-any-point-to-protesting) if we want to actually accomplish things that matter, and [protests can be an effective jumping-off point](https://qz.com/901411/political-protests-are-effective-but-not-for-the-reason-you-think/) for doing that. So, if you're planning to marth this Saturday, maybe you can get some people there to, for example, [sign the Environmental Voter Pledge](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sign-the-pledge). \n\n\n* **Population growth** is something [both the public and scientists are worried about](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/08/scientists-more-worried-than-public-about-worlds-growing-population/). There are [plenty of effective actions to take](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/361/6403/650.full.pdf?casa_token=eWZHHLNe6SwAAAAA:Vwhrywg2A8q_GOA1g1IjwZOaegqcHXkPIhWjDoVQfbgIwKiMHEOS7OXsn5bxSeMy5ANNN8U2kOswp5o) to curb population growth that *don't* involve [human rights violations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights#Sexual_and_reproductive_rights)), so please don't advocate for oppressive limits on the number of children other people can have. Rather, if you want to help curb overpopulation, [it would help to improve childhood mortality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=QsBT5EQt348), by, say [donating to](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities) the Against Malaria Foundation, or [donating to girls' education](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/education) to reduce fertility. Roughly [32 million unplanned births occur each year](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4727534/). Even in developed countries, [unintended pregnancies are common and costly](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/cdc-40-percent-us-births-unintended/story?id=16840288), and can have [deleterious effects on offspring](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3775543/), including a [higher risk of maltreatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26070372). [Implants, IUD, and sterilization](https://www.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Gynecologic-Practice/Increasing-Access-to-Contraceptive-Implants-and-Intrauterine-Devices-to-Reduce-Unintended-Pregnancy) are the most effective forms of birth control (yet [sterilization is often denied to women who know they don't want children](https://www.ted.com/talks/christen_reighter_i_don_t_want_children_stop_telling_me_i_ll_change_my_mind)) and [policies which give young people free access to the most reliable forms of birth control can greatly reduce unintended pregnancies](https://www.denverpost.com/2017/11/30/colorado-teen-pregnancy-abortion-rates-drop-free-low-cost-iud/).

As long as you assume our political institutions are not completely ethically bankrupt and hopeless, it should be one of your main concerns.\n\nVoting and the institutions relying on it mean very little if the voting process is fundamentally flawed and fails to represent the intent of the voters, and the information they are giving to the democratic processes. This is true both for the election of representatives to the way these representatives vote among themselves.\n\nSo why on Earth are we insisting on precisely the wrong methods for 2500 years? \n\nThe world desperately needs voting systems that promote maximization of consent and work towards consensus, not polarizing sides which only retaliate and waste time, resources and are easily swayed by corporate interests. This would allow new, truly representative positions and ideologies to hold official power and enact the decisions to remove corporate power from society and politics.\n\nOnly cardinal (non-ranked non-preferential) voting systems can do this while being simple enough to be adopted, because cardinal voting is not a zero-sum game. All voting being done today in the world is a zero-sum game, which is divisive and leads to a whole range of political, social and cultural problems.\n\nAs long as you admit money in politics work and attempt to use it, you already lost the battle. We need to dispel this idea that people have power over society because they are consumers and can boycott corporations. No. People have power because they are human beings, citizens, workers, voters. People have power because they are members of a society, not mere agents in an economy. \n\nSo they have power, right now, because they vote. So let's make the damn thing count for once in the history of our civilization.\n\nOther than that, I think we should stop framing the environmental problem solely in terms of climate change. Climate change is one of many interrelated environmental issues we're facing today in critical stages, but it's getting all of the attention. \n\n",

If you institute an ineffective carbon tax, people assume they don't need to make individual cuts to their footprint as they are contributing their 'fair' share via carbon tax. \n\nUnfortunately, to effect consumer behavior, carbon taxing would need to be onerous. If the carbon tax is onerous, it's going to hit the poor incredibly hard and be unpopular.  Can you imagine our increasingly polarized political parties coming together and instituting a carbon tax? That's why I advocate for things we can do now to reduce our carbon footprint. \n\nFurther, I think one of the biggest faults is that we don't have a very good carbon footprint spokesperson. Businesses may give a green press release, but they are not advertising it the way they should. Likewise, TV shows all these carbon hogs but doesn't really do anything similar for small footprints. \n\nIf you look back in time for similar magnitude projects, think WW2 victory gardens and posters like \"Use it up, wear it out, make it do!

That will inevitably result in some societies opting for authoritarian rule as it feels more safe than the alternative. \n\nThis may drive even more fear in some places, as it’s ultimately a self-fulfilling crisis. The authoritarian right will make conditions FAR worse, causing people to fracture into those who cling tighter to dictatorship and those who revolt against it, seeking democracy, green politics, etc. \n\nSadly, all of this political nonsense will likely play out as the Earth becomes more and more uninhabitable and we create irreversible ecological conditions that make recovery possible.

They are all in full agreement; there is no doubt that the warming that has been tracked alongside the CO2 rise of the industrial age is caused by it. CO2 has carbon in it; it traps heat and makes the air hotter. We put out a ton of it because of all the fossil fuel use. It’s very simple.\n\nYou people don’t even have a basic understanding of the facts right. Al Gore didn’t “invent this stuff”, and those aren’t “his graphs”- you should look up the Keeling Curve, THE KEELING CURVE You idiots!!! Look it up!!!! Also, why don’t you look through Nature Climate Change once a month, the climate segment of the world’s leading science journal.\n\nYou people are the largest part of the problem!

its great to be knowledgable. youre going to find youll have a lot more friends later as youre going to realize youve had an egotism problem that doesnt match your acuity and that youve been turning people off to you without realizing it. people can tolerate being told by someone theyre a genius if they are, not if theyre not. start over, through out every bit of knowledge you think youve learned, take up reading as a hobby, as a sport, as a lifestyle, as a tool, for a first time. the problem was right there, the solution starts right there, with proper reading. ill say it again youre not the only person ive met, from your age group, who has the same problem, says the same thing about it, says they were trained that way when they were younger (it was a fad at some point, they dont do it anymore), and acts just like you. i promise you sir ive just helped you out a lot please take my advice and try it. come back to me if you want to learn more and have a real talk about something. youll find *im* fantastically well read and have *actually been reading.* science isnt the only subject im versed on lets do war history, politics, ancient history, art history, religion, any day, anything, you name it. also a specialist in debunking the ufo phenomenon can tell you more about its history than most ufo nuts. what else can tell you everything about how to big game hunt. do any hunting in canada? can tell you anything about how the stock market works, do you invest at all? if you want to read anything ive written, ive written some stuff, a short book on an ancient egyptian board game (their version of chess), i have a journal-quality research article out like i said. those arent written in all lowercase without paragraph breaks or commas, youll see i have a professional style for those. love helping people, love talking about interesting stuff. anytime pal, glad to meet you as a friend, thanks for putting in the effort with me.",

                "body": "Carbon dioxide is Earth’s most important greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of our atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth’s surface and re-release it in all directions—including back toward Earth’s surface. Without carbon dioxide, Earth’s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing. By adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are supercharging the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise. \n\n\nAccording to observations by the NOAA Global Monitoring Lab, in 2021 carbon dioxide alone was responsible for about two-thirds of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases.\n\n How does carbon dioxide trap heat? You’ve probably already read that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases act like a blanket or a cap, trapping some of the heat that Earth might have otherwise radiated out into space. \n\nThat’s the simple answer. But how exactly do certain molecules trap heat? The answer there requires diving into physics and chemistry. Simplified diagram showing how Earth transforms sunlight into infrared energy. Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane absorb the infrared energy, re-emitting some of it back toward Earth and some of it out into space. When sunlight reaches Earth, the surface absorbs some of the light’s energy and reradiates it as infrared waves, which we feel as heat. (Hold your hand over a dark rock on a warm sunny day and you can feel this phenomenon for yourself.) These infrared waves travel up into the atmosphere and will escape back into space if unimpeded. \n\nOxygen and nitrogen don’t interfere with infrared waves in the atmosphere. That’s because molecules are picky about the range of wavelengths that they interact with, Smerdon explained. For example, oxygen and nitrogen absorb energy that has tightly packed wavelengths of around 200 nanometers or less, whereas infrared energy travels at wider and lazier wavelengths of 700 to 1,000,000 nanometers. Those ranges don’t overlap, so to oxygen and nitrogen, it’s as if the infrared waves don’t even exist; they let the waves (and heat) pass freely through the atmosphere. \n\n Energy from the Sun reaches Earth as mostly visible light. Earth reradiates that energy as infrared energy, which has a longer, slower wavelength. Whereas oxygen and nitrogen do not respond to infrared waves, greenhouse gases do. Credit: NASA With CO2 and other greenhouse gases, it’s different. \n\nCarbon dioxide, for example, absorbs energy at a variety of wavelengths between 2,000 and 15,000 nanometers — a range that overlaps with that of infrared energy. As CO2 soaks up this infrared energy, it vibrates and re-emits the infrared energy back in all directions. About half of that energy goes out into space, and about half of it returns to Earth as heat, contributing to the ‘greenhouse effect.’",

According to Hüseyin Yıldız, an expert Kangal dog breeder, the dogs’ once-thick and coarse fur is now thinning and discoloring.\n\n\"The thinning of their fur has resulted in a breakdown of their protective barrier,\" Yıldız explained. \"Just as global warming has caused changes in humans, it has induced even more significant alterations in animals. The density of their fur is decreasing considerably. With thick layers of fat beneath the skin, their insulation has been compromised, resulting in a thinner coat of about 1-1.5 centimeters. It’s as if they are adapting to a climate similar to that of Africa.",

Then it really sped up beginning with the Industrial Revolution that enabled the population to boom 8x what was before \n\nBiologists have observed, when a species has a population explosion, it eats up all its local resources, destroys its environment and it then experiences a mass die off until a new equilibrium is formed. We have seen this phenomena play out in smaller more isolated biomes with insects and rodents. It would be hubris to think it'll go any differently for us. \n\nThe problem is while climate change is accelerating on a human time scale, it is not so fast that everyone notices it....50 years in geologic time is imperceptible. Heck 5000 years is barely perceptible. \n\nWill humanity survive? Yes. But billions will die...but they'll die after everyone alive today is dead of old age.

The \"experts\" conclude that there *should* be dire effects and so report that they're happening regardless.\n\nPeople believe that the role of the news media is to inform. That's simply not true. The role of the media is to provide a platform for paid advertising. Every media outlet is out to make a profit, and the way to do that is to secure an audience and retain it. That means giving the audience what it wants. Until the advent of yellow journalism there were few newspapers that made money because people did not care about the general news. But, give them a lurid story and they bought the paper and read the ads. AGW and all of it's related scary stuff is lurid content driving readership. Once a website has a following of concerned people it's not about to run a story about how they were incorrect in previous articles. That drives readers away and hurts profits. So, the propaganda aspect is about having an audience hooked and reeling them in on a daily basis.\n\nI did a quick comparison 2 years ago between California’s “record breaking” fire year and a typical year in Manitoba: \n\n - Manitoba’s area is 250,900 sq/mi and 3100003 acres burned this year. So the burn rate was 12.3 acres per sq/mi/\n\n - California’s area is 163,696 sq/mi and 1968326 acres burned. That burn rate was  12 acres per sq/mi\n\nThe reason you don’t hear about Manitoba fires is that few people are ever in danger. Most of the fires in Manitoba are not reported in the media unless one threatens some remote community. The people evacuated then become “climate refugees” since being inconvenienced by nature is now part of the \"climate crisis\". \n\nManitoba burns for the same reason that California did; lack of fire prevention. In Manitoba it’s because we have huge uninhabited areas. The situation in California is very different but leads to the same result. With only a little digging you will find many reports like the one below which was written prior to the massive fires:\n\nhttps://lhc.ca.gov/report/fire-mountain-rethinking-forest-management-sierra-nevada\n\nWhere they tell us the Commission found that California’s forests suffer from neglect and mismanagement, resulting in overcrowding that leaves them susceptible to disease, insects and wildfire. Complicating the management problem is the fact that the State of California owns very few of the forests within its borders – most are owned by the federal government or private landowners.\n\nThose fires were only waiting to happen. The spur to getting them started was the Pacific ocean phenomenon of ENSO. There are 3 phases to ENSO” warm, cool, and neutral. ENSO has only been studied since 1950. In that short period of data we find that ENSO was dominated by La Nina (cool) from 1950-75 and El Nino (warm) from 1976-2000. ENSO has reverted to La Nina dominance since, though it has gone through a couple of extreme El Ninos notably in 2010. During the 25 year El Nino period there was lots of rain which led to massive and unchecked forest growth. Now we have La Nina and forests have dried out bringing the perfect conditions for fires. \n\nTornadoes have not increased: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/societal-impacts/tornadoes/1/8?fatalities=false&mean=true  \n\nData adjustment indicates no upward trend in tornadoes \nhttps://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/53/6/jamc-d-13-0235.1.xml\n\n - Because of the obvious importance of significant tornadoes in producing death and destruction, considerable attention has been given to these data trends for 1953–2012. Even with the adjustments to the F2 counts before 1974, the significant tornado annual totals are trending down\n\nTornado counts in US tied to ENSO cycle:\n\nhttps://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/55/8/jamc-d-15-0342.1.xml\n\n - On the basis of a warming trend over the past 30 years, the modern tornado record can be divided into a cold “Period I” from 1954 to 1983 and a subsequent 30-year warm “Period II” from 1984 to 2013.\n\nWhere the period 1950-75 was La Nina dominant while 1975-2000 was El Nino dominant.\n\nHurricane data NOAA US: https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastdec.shtml\n\nhttp://tropical.atmos.colostate.edu/Realtime/index.php?arch&loc=global\n\nHurricane intensity: \n\n - Revisions to record - https://stthomassource.com/content/2021/08/23/researchers-adding-missed-hurricanes-to-the-official-records/\n\n  From NOAA Hurricane Research Division:\n  \nhttps://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/All_U.S._Hurricanes.html\n\n https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hw1-1.png\n\nhttps://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hw2-1.png\n\nThe above are all telling us that reports of increases in activity are bogus.

Try to sustain yourself with a food source that doesn't involve either ocean fish or red meat, because ocean fisheries are collapsing and high-yield livestock rearing is reliant on regions that will soon be uninhabitable for long periods of the year.\n\nNone of this will likely come to pass in 10 years, but much of it will come to pass in 50 assuming current trends get worse.\n\nThere won't really be a \"safe place,\" though.

Paleoclimatic data show it has been unstable in the past, leading to some of the most dramatic and abrupt climate shifts known. These instabilities are due to two different types of tipping points, one linked to amplifying feedbacks in the large-scale salt transport and the other in the convective mixing that drives the flow.

I eat less meat, but I do go to a local butcher for it. Befriended my neighbors and shared food and clothes with them. \n\nNo more junk food. I'm boycotting coke products mostly and fast food chains. It's amazing and disturbing how big soda companies have grown and caused damage. I bake at home when I have a sweet tooth or go to a pandería or bakery.\n\n More independent businesses are making their own cosmetics, and I just stock some lotions and moisturizers from them online or at farmer's markets.  I wear less makeup now. Lots of fruits and vegetables at farmer's markets, too. Local soap makers also help a bunch, I get my haircare from them, too.\n\nI do some research on the companies I am inevitable to buy from and make strategic purchases, but I mostly stay away from big brands in general.\n\nI rent movies from the library or borrow from friends and family for entertainment and stick to only a couple of streaming services like Max because I like Jon Oliver. Disney and Netflix are too big for comfort. I've started reading more and checked out many novels and graphic novels.\n\nIm still learning. I do wonder if this is done on a larger scale, how much it would impact some corporations.",

This budget represents the maximum amount of carbon emissions that can be released while still having a chance to meet the Paris Agreement's temperature goals.\n\nThe study, published in Nature Climate Change, provides the most recent and comprehensive analysis of the carbon budget to date. It estimates that only about 250 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions remain for a 50% chance of keeping global temperature rise below 1.5°C. This is half the size of the budget estimated in 2020 and would be exhausted in just six years at current emission levels. The researchers found that to maintain this 50% chance, global emissions would need to plummet to net zero by 2034, which is far faster than even the most ambitious current scenarios.\n\nThe analysis also examined the implications for the 2°C upper limit of the Paris Agreement. For a 90% chance of staying below 2°C, emissions would need to reach net zero around 2035. The study's findings are based on updated data, improved climate modeling, and new understanding of how reducing air pollution affects global heating. The researchers emphasize that while the 1.5°C goal may be slipping out of reach, every fraction of a degree matters in terms of reducing human suffering and environmental impacts. They stress the importance of continued efforts to limit warming as much as possible, even if the 1.5°C target is exceeded.\n\n[Article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/30/climate-crisis-carbon-emissions-budget) → [Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01848-5)",

In Nepal, the authorities are worried about forest fires increasing in \"unimaginable proportion.\" In India, where election campaigning has been disrupted by high temperatures, Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari suffered a stroke during an election rally. The opening hours of some polling stations were extended to allow voters to travel after dark.\n\nFrom Vietnam to Bangladesh to Thailand, record-breaking temperatures are on the rise. Asia is warming faster than the global average, according to data from the World Meteorological Organization, and must prepare for longer, more frequent and more intense heatwaves. The consequences of these are well known. They kill, weaken social cohesion, can destroy harvests, damage infrastructure and reduce incomes by preventing people from working. All these effects are even more devastating for the poor and for women, although this is less well known.\n\nRising temperatures increase the risk of violence, including domestic violence. A study, published in the journal [JAMA Psychiatry in June 2023](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2806604) and involving 190,000 women from Pakistan, India and Nepal, shows that a one-degree rise in temperature coincides with a 6.3% increase in acts of domestic violence, due to worsening living conditions and accompanying stress. It also leads to complications for pregnant women, with an increase in the number of miscarriages and premature deliveries.\n\n**Read the full article here:** [**https://www.lemonde.fr/en/opinion/article/2024/05/08/women-the-first-victims-of-global-warming\\_6670770\\_23.html**](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/opinion/article/2024/05/08/women-the-first-victims-of-global-warming_6670770_23.html)",

It does not include other planet-warming gases such as methane. Almost half the total CO2 emissions were down to US cargo planes flying military supplies to Israel.”\n\n“Hamas rockets fired into Israel during the same period generated about 713 tonnes of CO2, which is equivalent to approximately 300 tonnes of coal – underscoring the asymmetry of each side’s war machinery.”\n\nbullshit half measure apologism for a genocidal regime is wild. \n\nReal environmentalists are fighting RICO charges for organizing against cop cities and trying to preserve old growth forests, they’re in prisons because they disrupted pipelines, they actually fight for something outside of an electoral victory by someone who is abysmal in so many ways for the environment.\n\nThe paper if you’re interested: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4684768",

One of the reasons we're doing that is to get us out from under the thumb of OPEC and so that we have more influence over global energy prices and more leverage on global energy going forward, which allows us to pressure other countries and/or OPEC towards better climate goals and to prevent them from raising prices to effect political change.\n\n> The soaring domestic oil output has already begun to reshape geopolitical dynamics. The United States is producing so much oil that it has undermined the influence of OPEC, which failed when it tried to make production cuts recently to drive prices up globally. The amount cut was quickly backfilled by the United States and other non-OPEC nations, which gladly grabbed the market share OPEC forfeited.

I learned some things from it as well.\n\n-\nIf the US didn't want Russia to invade Ukraine, then we shouldn't have expanded NATO ever-eastward.  We've known since the 90s ([here's a video of Biden in 1997](https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-resurfaced-clip-russia-baltic-states-1997-video-1685864)) that expanding NATO eastward would cause problems.\n\n-\nIf the US didn't want Russia to invade Ukraine, then we shouldn't have held a coup in Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThis led to Azov and other paramilitary groups killing Russian-speaking *Ukrainian* citizens.  And the government did nothing (maybe they were powerless).  From 2014-2022, 30,000 citizens on both sides were killed in the fighting.  You really need to read that other link, to get more info.\n\nRussia invaded as a peace-keeping force.  Per agreements in that link.\n\nETA: If Ukraine had abided by the [Minsk agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk_agreements) and stopped killing its citizens, then Russia wouldn't have had to invade.

One such scientist, speaking with LiveScience, said that “ it begs credulity to claim that the instrumental record is wrong based on paleosponges from one region of the world… It honestly doesn’t make any sense to me.” Other experts expressed wanting to see more data before completely upending the IPCC’s climate goalposts, which say the Earth is currently hovering at a long-term temperature change of around 1.2 degrees Celsius.\n\nThis is the issue. Science doesn't move at the pace of disaster. We will burn while scientists re-write their grant proposals and bicker over edits. While nothing is done. Obviously its not up to scientists to enact the change. But its clear some phenomena outpace peer review.

Because there is nothing to suggest that the Pleistocene has actually ended, certain authorities prefer to extend the Pleistocene up to the present time; this approach tends to ignore humans and their impact, however. In addition, some geologists have argued that the time [characterized](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/characterized) by the rise of humanity should be separated from the time characterized by humanity’s domination over the planet’s ecological systems and [biogeochemical cycles](https://www.britannica.com/science/biogeochemical-cycle), and thus they have proposed that the later part of the Holocene should be classified as a new geologic epoch called the [Anthropocene](https://www.britannica.com/science/Anthropocene-Epoch). Despite such proposals, the Holocene remains the chronological framework for human history. Archaeologists use it as the time standard against which they trace the development of early civilizations.\" \n\nWhat you say is up for debate.

In the North Atlantic, for example, plankton have already declined over the last 50 years. However, what happens further up the food web - up to the stocks of commercially exploited fish - is far from clear. Some models suggest little change in fish and others project a major decline and importantly, the mechanisms vary greatly from model to model.

I missed it during my first skim.\n\nExtract from the article:\n\n“The emissions would be collected from several industrial sources nearby, compressed into a liquid-like state and injected into porous rock more than one mile underground.”\n\nThat was mixed with this later. \n\n“Environmentalists also say that the transportation and injection of CO2 — an asphyxiating gas that displaces oxygen — could lead to dangerous leaks. Nationwide, there have been at least 25 carbon dioxide pipeline leaks between 2002 and 2021, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.”\n\nAnd this \n\n“SoCalGas injects and stores methane inside a depleted oil reservoir in the Santa Susana Mountains near Los Angeles’ Porter Ranch neighborhood. But in October 2015, one of Aliso Canyon’s 115 gas wells developed an uncontrolled leak that lasted for nearly four months. About 100,000 tons of methane were released and more than 5,000 households were evacuated.”\n\nSo the article at very fast skim didn’t get the key point across.\n\nThis is why I tend to post extracts.\nYou need a point that has substance that can draw people in, to encourage them to read the full article if they have a direct interest. \n\nHowever the financial return comes from attracting viewers for as long time as possible, so that the metrics so the point is hidden to encourage people to have to read more, consuming their time. \n\nThis is caused by faulty management structures, as the focus in senior leadership is usually on this: https://www.nielsen.com/insights/2016/newspapers-deliver-across-the-ages/ - being able to demonstrate to shareholders that they are meeting targets that make them competitive so they can attract attention and advertisers, by indicating their readership hours.\n\nReddit does the same, however it’s less focused on income from advertising as it’s an intelligence collective that (when not moderated or shadow banning at the force of military or police or intelligence agencies - see https://buffer.com/library/shadowbanned/amp/ ) isn’t as reliant on advertising income due to it’s very different economies of scale, not being geographically focused, and instead being international, and even in more than one language and incorporating mathematics and science and programming.",

Then Republicans won the midterms and regained and held power in Congress thereby stopping the rest of his agenda and a liberal supreme court justice nominee for the next 6 years of his tenure.\n\nBiden can't control red states and you think he can control a sovereign nation like Israel? Biden has no love for Netanyahu and his right wing government whose politics are even more extreme than that of the GOPs. The reason why they US has always supported Israel is because we support every democracy throughout the world whether its Taiwan or Ukraine because even if those current government in those countries suck...like Israel's does now, they can be improved upon in their next election just as ours was when Biden defeated Trump.\n\nPeople here complaining that Democrats aren't doing enough fail to realize that Republicans are fighting them tooth and nail not just in DC but in every red state. The GOP is trying to overturn all progressive legislation like the Civil Rights Act and Clean Water Act. \n\nDemocrats are unfortunately fighting their asses off to keep the hard fought gains they've already won, which unfortunately means they are rather limited in their ability to advance more progressive causes.\n\nYou complain that Biden is not packing the supreme court when democrats introduced such a bill this past summer. https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/democrats-introduce-bill-to-expand-u-s-supreme-court/ \n\nWill the bill go anywhere? No because Republicans who control the House won't vote for it. That's how democracies work...yes it's frustrating but that's how its been since the founding of the USA. \n\nFor fuck's sake, take a political science class and learn how our republic form of democratic government actually functions and what each branch of government can actually do at the national, state and local levels. Presidents thankfully are not kings and it's a good thing too, otherwise Trump would have made himself one. If you don't like our current government then get the 50% of young voters who currently don't vote to start giving a shit and vote for more progressive candidates that way instead of fighting to save what we got, Dems can actually do some good.",

Most of the reduction will happen in advanced economies and China.

Most of the reduction will happen in advanced economies and China. In the rest of the world, the demand will increase significantly.  \nGlobal natural gas consumption to peak around 2030 at 4000 bcm per year and stay at that level through 2050. Most of the reduction will happen in advanced economies. China's demand to stay flat. In the rest of the world, the demand will increase slowly.  \nAnnual solar installation to reach 580 GW by 2050 from 220 GW in 2022. For net zero scenario (NZE), more aggressive than STEPS, the annual solar installation must increase to 820 GW by 2030 and stay at that level through 2050.

Feel free to fact-check.) \n\n\nIce-Albedo Feedback: \n\n       Ice and snow have high albedo, meaning they reflect much of the sun's energy. As the planet warms and ice melts, darker ocean water or land is exposed, which absorbs more sunlight. This absorption causes further warming, which in turn causes more ice melt, and so on.\n\nCarbon Cycle Feedbacks:Permafrost Melt: \n\n      Large areas of the Arctic have ground that's permanently frozen, called permafrost. As temperatures rise, this permafrost can thaw, releasing methane and carbon dioxide—both potent greenhouse gases—into the atmosphere, which further accelerates warming.\n\nOcean Carbon Uptake: \n\n      As the ocean warms, its capacity to absorb carbon dioxide diminishes. A warmer ocean will absorb less CO₂, leaving more in the atmosphere, which further accelerates warming.\n\nWater Vapor Feedback: \n\n      Warm air holds more moisture than cold air. As the Earth warms, the atmosphere can hold—and does hold—more water vapor. Water vapor itself is a potent greenhouse gas, so this increase amplifies the greenhouse effect, leading to more warming.\n\n\nCloud Feedback: \n\n      Changes in cloud cover and type can affect how much solar energy the Earth reflects or absorbs. While clouds can have both warming and cooling effects, current evidence suggests that cloud changes due to global warming might further warm the planet.\n\nOcean Stratification: \n\n      As the Earth warms, the oceans become more stratified, meaning the warm and cold layers don't mix as effectively. This can reduce the upwelling of nutrients from the deep, affecting marine life and also impacting the ocean's ability to absorb carbon.\n\nForest Dieback: \n\n       In some areas, increasing temperatures and changing precipitation patterns, along with pests and diseases, are causing forests to die. Forests act as carbon sinks, storing more carbon than they release. When forests die and decompose or burn, they release stored carbon into the atmosphere, contributing to further warming.\n\nDesertification and Soil Feedback: \n\n       As certain regions become drier due to climate change, they can experience desertification. This process reduces the soil's ability to act as a carbon sink and can lead to the release of stored carbon.\n\nedit: formatting.",

[Source is the IPCC report, graph 1.5](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/graphics/#cid_455)\n\nThere's confusion in this topic because stabilizing the concentration of c02 in the atmosphere (a stop in c02eq increases) does not immediately stabilize global temperature. The confusion is solved when you realize that (human) net zero implies (global) net negative (from ocean and vegetation absorptions). It's slightly more complicated because net zero would imply in net aerosols, but the math still checkouts to no additional warming as soon as net zero is attained. Again, in doubt see the source in question.\n\ntl;dr: Any future warming is fully a human commitment and in 'our' hands. The faster we act the faster we will reap the benefits.",

All that single-use plastic and Styrofoam, especially for cold packaging, is contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and consequently climate change.\n\nMajor companies, like Amazon, say they are trying to reduce packaging, but of the 380 million tons of plastic produced annually about half of it is for single-use purposes, like product packaging and Styrofoam.\n\nNow, companies like TemperPack, Green Cell and a California-based startup called Cruz Foam are making more recyclable and biodegradable packaging. Cruz Foam is using shrimp shells in its packaging.\n\n“What we’ve done is really built a process which allows us to take this waste and essentially manufacture and turn it into large-scale replacements for plastics,” said John Felts, CEO of Cruz Foam.\n\nThe foam is made from chitin, a material found in shrimp shells, insects, and fungi. It is biodegradable, so you can either compost it or it will just degrade quickly itself in a landfill. Felts calls it “earth digestible.” Since it is made from waste, the costs are lower than other biomaterials. And Cruz Foam doesn’t make the packages, rather it provides packagers with the material.\n\n“We scale with existing manufacturing and that has allowed us to reach economies of scale and cost very quickly,” added Felts.\n\nThe company is already working with Rivian and Whirlpool, and investors see big opportunities.\n\nMore: [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/02/cruz-foam-making-packaging-out-of-shrimp-shells.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/02/cruz-foam-making-packaging-out-of-shrimp-shells.html)",

Consider the shady practices employed companies that imported rice laced with plastic pellets and diluted baby formula. \n\nIt’s pretty difficult to trace the origin of these crimes and a fine against the company is no comfort in cases of deaths. Pets died from eating plastic riddled food. There was a formula shortage in China due to the lack of oversight causing locals to eschew their country’s own formulas. \n\nWhat you must ask yourself is: is cheap, imported food worth the game of roulette unethical companies play with consumers? Any company that whines about the expense of environmental, ethical, labor or safety practices is someone you can’t trust with your life, no less your money. \n\nShrimp can be farmed ethically with environmentally safe packaging and fairly locally.

The 3rd world is obviously screwed.

But of course things don't work that simple since we have systems that deflect missiles. And since nukes are launched into a high orbit, even a tiny shift means it can pretty much end up anywhere in the world. So nukes will pretty much contaminate most if not all of the world, if not initially then the spread afterwards. The ones that detonate in orbit will cause EMP knocking out all communication all of the world, and nuclear radiation spreads through water, soil and air contaminating the food system. The world would also go through a nuclear winter as things blown into the atmosphere block the sun. 99.99% of humanity would go extinct, with all ecosystems collapsing as well",

During this time, the climate was warmer and wetter than today, and the sea level was higher due to the melting of polar ice sheets. The carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere was also similar to today’s, which means that the Pliocene can serve as a useful analog for the future effects of global warming.\nAccording to some sources, the global average temperature in the mid-Pliocene (3.3–3 mya) was 2–3 °C higher than today, carbon dioxide levels were the same as today, and global sea level was 25 m higher1. The Pliocene oceans’ estimated response to higher temperatures and CO2 levels was a rise of about 56 feet above today’s mean sea level2. The Pliocene sea-level fluctuations were mainly a response to changes in polar ice storage, but they also include about three to four feet of sea-level rise from thermal expansion of the warmer ocean waters2.\n\"\n\nOk, so me typing again.\n\nThe previous times there's been major glaciations and thaws, and even minor glaciations and thaws, humans hadn't cleared half the forest off the planet.\n\nThat's an issue due to albedo. Cleared land has a serious effect, not only on life on earth, killing much & reducing diversity mostly, it also means we loose heat from the sun. I'm not sure how well science understands that, this is all a large complex system with limited written records. I was quite happy with the climate as it was, another major ice age or full melt is a lot of work. If not for me, then for my descendants and of course everyone else here. \n\nThere's lots of land above the full melt mark, however the issue is food grows well on land in river deltas and so on. If it all floods you end up reverting back to land that hasn't got the regular silt restoration.  That's a ... bit of a simplification! \n\nAlso, the IPCC assessments are short term. A few hundred years is nothing. I'm interested in planning out what's coming beyond the next hundreds to thousands of years, so I have an idea what might occur if an unexpected different outcome eventuates. It's not disaster addictions. It's simple.  I don't think it's worth doing something if it's only going to be worthless from flooding or ice later. Even a simple house for my family should be one where people don't feel like their efforts are wasted or they caused suffering or diversity extinctions making life less special or wondrous if you travel, or look closely, and more like a bare Lego dioarama, simple, artificial and all the same boring plastic. \n\nThese people have some views. \n\nhttps://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/NASASeaLevel\n\nI can highlight an example of a potential flaw in the IPCC reports. It's derived from old sand waves underwater radiating out from sea ice holding back glaciers. \n\nIt's complex. I don't presently follow or code for or model the mathematics myself. There's probably years to decades to become accomplished at that. Eg. Look at the modelling here. \n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-glaciology/article/comparisons-of-seaice-velocity-fields-from-ers1-sar-and-a-dynamic-model/AAB1BDEBD23DF6C6DEACB3A27763288D\n\nHere's another variation:\n\nhttps://hakaimagazine.com/news/coastal-flooding-will-be-more-extensive-sooner-than-scientists-thought/\n\nBut the point I wanted to make was this.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/05/ice-sheets-collapse-far-faster-than-feared-study-climate-crisis\n\nPerhaps you don't care for the Guardian due to some political views.

The main issue is they didn’t complain loud enough about what Manchin and Sinema were doing. The news did not harp on it too much either, some smaller orgs ran (somewhat accurate) smears on Manchin and Sinema but they were not very loud. Sinema answering to donors instead of voters should inspire serious issues but it’s just business as usual. You need the base to get riled up about it as well and Biden and Co. are complaining at what seems like a whisper. They should be saying over and over again how much they suck. But there are downsides to that which is why it is not done, but now your package looks a bit lame to the voters you told would be trillions. And of course inflation made things more difficult but we got a planet to save here - saying it’s too expensive is a hilarious joke when the future cost will leave you beyond negative and with lots of death. You don’t have to spam like Trump but bring it up. \n\n2. If justified, consider making it personal. Manchin conflict of interest with coal is abhorrent. We had a standard of making politicians get rid of all business ties before but now we are lame on that regard. Manchin’s daughter was at the center of an epi pen price fixing scandal. Smear her or consider slapping her in the face with a justified price fixing charge or something of the sort. Drag that family’s name through the mud.\n\nYou get the gist.",

If we hyper-focus on just reducing emissions and lose out on other priorities such as bio-diversity and freshwater, then the planet is in big trouble.\n\nBut the reduction of carbon emissions will have impact on eight out of the nine axes that are in that link (ozone depletion is already covered under the Montreal Protocol). I can provide sources for each one if needed:\n\nLoss of biosphere integrity: increased temperatures increases the threat of extinction for may species.\n\nChemical pollution: fossil fuel extraction is a major source of toxic chemical runoff and ground water pollution\n\nClimate change: is a axis all by it self.\n\nOcean acidification: your link says: “Around a quarter of the CO2 that humanity emits into the atmosphere is ultimately dissolved in the oceans.” Emissions reductions would help with this\n\nFreshwater consumption and the global hydrological cycle: your links says: “The freshwater cycle is strongly affected by climate change and its boundary is closely linked to the climate boundary.” So emissions reductions will help with freshwater too.\n\nLand system change: climate change is causing more forest fires that are greatly reducing forest land.\n\nNitrogen and phosphorus flows to the biosphere and oceans: the burning of fossil fuels is a source of nitrogen in the air, that eventually ends up in the ocean.\n\nAtmospheric aerosol loading: fossil fuel burning is a source of aerosols.\n\nSo when I say reducing carbon emissions is important, it is not just because it effects one axis, but because it impacts all of them but one. They are interrelated and while taking action on climate change will not fix all of the environmental problems in the world, it will\nImpact all of the environmental problems in the world and is therefore of great significance.\n\nIn addition, reducing carbon emissions does not take away from any other program that is designed to protect the other axes. I argue that reducing emissions complements all other environmental action and therefore it is noteworthy when a breakthrough like the Inflation Reduction Act happens.",
